  - Try to keep from fallin' between the cars

  - My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
  - When my mother died my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor

  - We live in a political world
  - Love don't have any place
  - We're living in times where men commit crimes
  - And crime don't have a face
  - We live in a political world
  - Icicles hanging down
  - Wedding bells ring and angels sing
  - And clouds cover up the ground
  - We live in a political world
  - Wisdom is thrown into jail
  - It rots in a cell, misguided as hell
  - Leaving no one to pick up a trail
  - We live in a political world
  - Where mercy walks the plank
  - Life is in mirrors, death disappears
  - Up the steps into the nearest bank
  - We live in a political world
  - Where courage is a thing of the past
  - Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
  - The next day could be your last
  - We live in a political world
  - The one we can see and can feel
  - But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck
  - We all know for sure that it's real
  - We live in a political world
  - The cities of a lonesome fear
  - Little by little you turn in the middle
  - But you're never sure why you're here
  - We live in a political world
  - Under the microscope
  - You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
  - You always got more than enough rope
  - We live in a political world
  - Turning and a'thrashing about
  - As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
  - What looks like the easy way out
  - We live in a political world
  - Where peace is not welcome at all
  - It's turned away from the door to wander some more
  - Or put up against the wall
  - We live in a political world
  - Everything is hers or his
  - Climb into the frame and shout God's name
  - But you're never sure what it is

  - A country dance was being held in a garden
  - I felt a bump and heard an, "Oh, beg your pardon"
  - Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
  - All around a pug-nosed dream
  - The music started and was I the perplexed one
  - I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
  - In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
  - Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream
  - There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
  - As we floated over the floor
  - There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
  - And perhaps a few things more
  - Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
  - I know the meaning of the words, "Ever after"
  - And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
  - When I kiss the pug-nosed dream

  - Precious angel, under the sun,
  - How was I to know you'd be the one
  - To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
  - How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
  - Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down.
  - You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
  - The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
  - When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - You know I just couldn't make it by myself.
  - I'm a little too blind to see.
  - My so-called friends have fallen under a spell.
  - They look me squarely in the eye and they say, All is well.
  - Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
  - When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
  - Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw.
  - You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law.
  - You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed
  - In the same breath.
  - You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death.
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - You know I just couldn't make it by myself.
  - I'm a little too blind to see.
  - Precious angel, you believe me when I say
  - What God has given to us no man can take away.
  - We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves.
  - Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
  - You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
  - You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night.
  - But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
  - On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ.
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - Shine your light, shine your light on me
  - You know I just couldn't make it by myself.
  - I'm a little too blind to see.

  - '''Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw'
  - Oklahoma knew him well
  - It was in the town of Shawnee
  - On a Saturday afternoon
  - His wife beside him in a wagon
  - As into town they rode
  - There a deputy sheriff approached him
  - In a manner rather rude
  - Using vulgar words of language
  - An' his wife she overheard
  - Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
  - And the deputy grabbed his gun
  - In the fight that followed
  - He laid that deputy down
  - Now, he took to the hills and timber
  - To live a life of shame
  - Every crime in Oklahoma
  - Was added to his name
  - He took to the trees and timber
  - On the Canadian river shore
  - And pretty Boy found a welcome
  - At every farmer's door
  - Others tell you of a stranger
  - That come to beg a meal
  - And underneath the napkin
  - Left a thousand dollar bill
  - T'was in Oklahoma City
  - It was on a Christmas Day
  - There come a whole car load of groceries
  - 'And a letter that did say:'
  - You say that I'm an outlaw
  - You say that I'm a thief
  - Well, here's a Christmas dinner
  - For the families on relief
  - Well, it's through this world I've rambled
  - I've seen lots of funny men
  - Some will rob you with a six-gun
  - And some with a fountain pen
  - Well, it's through this world you ramble
  - It's through this world you roam
  - You won't never see an outlaw
  - Drive a family from their home

  - Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone
  - But I would not feel so all alone
  - Everybody must get stoned
  - Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' on the street
  - They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
  - They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor

  - They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
  - They'll stone you when you are young and able
  - They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck
  - They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck
  - Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone

  - Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end
  - Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
  - They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
  - They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
  - Yes, but I would not feel so all alone

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Rambling,_Gambling_Willie
  - Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell
  - About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
  - His name was Will O' Conley and he gambled all his life,
  - He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
  - Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
  - He had a reputation as the gamblin'est man around,
  - Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
  - They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen.
  - '"I''ve come to win some money," Gamblin'' Willie says,'
  - When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
  - There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
  - Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
  - When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
  - He supported all his children, and all their mothers too.
  - He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore,
  - He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
  - Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true.
  - He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair.
  - The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - It was late one evenin' during a poker game,
  - A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame.
  - He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
  - When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.
  - So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be,
  - The moral of this story is very plain to see.
  - Make your money while you can, before you have to stop,
  - For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up.
  - And it's ride, Willie, ride,
  - Roll, Willie, roll,
  - Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows.

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Restless_Farewell
  - Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend
  - Be it mine right or wrongfully
  - I let it slip gladly to my friends
  - To tie up the time most forcefully
  - But the bottles are done, we've killed each one
  - And the table's full and overflowed
  - And the corner sign says it's closing time
  - So I'll bid farewell and be down the road
  - Oh, every girl that ever I've touched
  - I did not do it harmfully
  - And every girl that ever I've hurt
  - I did not do it knowingly
  - But to remain as friends
  - You need the time to make amends and stay behind
  - And since my feet are now fast and point away from the past
  - I'll bid farewell and be down the line
  - Oh, every foe that ever I faced
  - The cause was there before we came
  - And every cause that ever I fought
  - I fought it full without regret or shame
  - But the dark does die
  - As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes must meet the dawn
  - And if I see the day I'd only have to stay
  - So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone
  - Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind
  - I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung
  - But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes
  - It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung
  - But the time ain't tall
  - Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed by no special friend
  - And though the line is cut, it ain't quite the end
  - I'll just bid farewell 'til we meet again
  - Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time
  - To disgrace, distract, and bother me
  - And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
  - And the dust of rumors covers me
  - But if the arrow is straight and the point is slick
  - It can pierce through dust, no matter how thick
  - So I'll make my stand and remain as I am
  - And bid farewell and not give a damn

  - Ring them bells, ye heathen
  - From the city that dreams
  - Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
  - Cross the valleys and streams
  - For they're deep and they're wide
  - And the world's on its side
  - And time is running backwards
  - And so is the bride.
  - Ring them bells St. Peter
  - Where the four winds blow
  - Ring them bells with an iron hand
  - So the people will know
  - Oh it's rush hour now
  - On the wheel and the plow
  - And the sun is going down
  - Upon the sacred cow.
  - Ring them bells Sweet Martha
  - For the poor man's son
  - Ring them bells so the world will know
  - That God is one
  - Oh the shepherd is asleep
  - Where the willows weep
  - And the mountains are filled
  - With lost sheep
  - Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
  - Ring them bells for all of us who are left
  - Ring them bells for the chosen few
  - Who will judge the many when the game is through
  - Ring them bells, for the time that flies
  - For the child that cries
  - When innocence dies
  - Ring them bells St. Catherine
  - From the top of the room
  - Ring them from the fortress
  - For the lilies that bloom
  - Oh the lines are long
  - And the fighting is strong
  - And they're breaking down the distance
  - Between right and wrong

  - Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
  - He turned around and he slowly walked away
  - They shot him in the back and down he went
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets
  - Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen
  - Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
  - Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - Sailing through the trade winds bound for the South
  - Rags on your back just like any other slave
  - They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
  - Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - I heard the news today, oh boy
  - They hauled your ship up on the shore
  - Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
  - They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - Put on your bags and get 'em packed
  - Leave right now you won't be far from wrong
  - The sooner you go, the quicker you'll be back
  - You've been cooped up on an island far too long
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - Slow down you're moving way too fast
  - Come together right now over me
  - Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
  - Lord, you know how hard that it can be
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow
  - Take the righthand road and go where the buffaloes roam
  - They'll trap you in an ambush 'fore you know
  - Too late now to sail back home
  - Shine your light
  - Move it on
  - You burn so bright
  - Roll on John
  - Tyger, Tyger burning bright
  - I pray the lord my soul to keep
  - In the forest of the night
  - Cover him over and let him sleep

  - Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
  - Dust on my face and my cape,
  - Me and Magdalena on the run
  - I think this time we shall escape.
  - Sold my guitar to the baker's son
  - For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
  - But I can get another one
  - And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
  - No llores, mi querida
  - Dios nos vigila
  - Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
  - Agarrame, mi vida
  - Soon the desert will be gone
  - Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
  - Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
  - Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
  - At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
  - Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
  - Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
  - Was it my hand that held the gun?
  - Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
  - The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
  - No llores, mi querida
  - Dios nos vigila
  - Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
  - Agarrame, mi vida
  - Soon the desert will be gone
  - Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
  - At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
  - And watch the young torero stand alone.
  - We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
  - When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
  - Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
  - In the little church this side of town.
  - I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
  - You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
  - The way is long but the end is near
  - Already the fiesta has begun.
  - The face of God will appear
  - With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
  - No llores, mi querida
  - Dios nos vigila
  - Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
  - Agarrame, mi vida
  - Soon the desert will be gone
  - Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
  - Was that the thunder that I heard?
  - My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
  - Come sit by me, don't say a word
  - Oh, can it be that I am slain?
  - Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
  - Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
  - Aim well my little one
  - We may not make it through the night.
  - No llores, mi querida
  - Dios nos vigila
  - Soon the horse will take us to Durango.

  - And I know you knew that.
  - I bought a joke, a trick or two,
  - Just to bring and show you,
  - Caught ya with the trickster too.
  - Sometimes I wonder how ya knew
  - A hypnotist, fancytalker,
  - Ruben remus ain't no doctor
  - I knew the man and tried to remember
  - Just where it was that I'd seen his face.
  - Long ago, in a movie show,
  - He was like that man singin' bass.
  - 'Knew him by his nurs''ry rhyme:'
  - The story of the rabbit man.
  - 'Fell right in and said to him:'
  - '"I''d like to help you if I can."'
  - I know the film would only shock ya,
  - Ruben remus ain't no doctor!
  - He only needed what you had,
  - Asked for nothing more,
  - Said he'd like to take you on,
  - But it's been done before.
  - You couldn't see he's a travelin' man
  - And he cannot take your hand.
  - It's very hard to understand
  - Why his songs were never banned.
  - Guess the man would never knock ya,
  - Ruben remus ain't no doctor!
  - No one seen ya since he's been gone,
  - It's been a day, maybe more.
  - I took a walk in your yard
  - And knocked on your back door.
  - Why don't you let me in?
  - I'm not the man who did ya in.
  - Is mr. remus still your friend?
  - You say you don't remember him.
  - Turn me down, would ya?
  - Well, I've got news for you.
  - Turn me down would ya,
  - Can't ya tell
  - I'm gonna change your mind before I'm... trough...

  - With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
  - And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
  - And your silver cross and your voice like chimes
  - Oh, who do they think could bury you?
  - With your pockets well-protected at last
  - And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass
  - And your flesh like silk and your face like glass
  - Who could they get to carry you?
  - Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
  - Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
  - My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
  - Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
  - With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
  - And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
  - And your basement clothes and your hollow face
  - Who among them did think he could outguess you?
  - With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
  - Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
  - And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
  - Who among them would try to impress you?
  - Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
  - Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
  - My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
  - Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
  - The kings of Tyrus, with their convict list
  - Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
  - And you wouldn't know it would have happened like this
  - But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
  - With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
  - And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
  - And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
  - Who among them do you think could resist you?
  - Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
  - Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
  - My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
  - Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
  - Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
  - To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
  - But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
  - How could they ever mistake you?
  - They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm
  - But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
  - And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
  - How could they ever have persuaded you?
  - Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
  - Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man's come
  - My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
  - Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
  - With your sheet metal memory of Cannery Row
  - And your magazine husband who one day just had to go
  - And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show
  - Who among them do you think would employ you?
  - Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
  - With your holy medallion in your fingertips now enfold
  - And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul
  - Who among them could ever think he could destroy you?
  - Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
  - Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
  - My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
  - Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

  - Look who's back in town
  - Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
  - All you boys better run for cover
  - If you don't a-wanna be a hearted broken lover.
  - See her in that very tight skirt
  - 'Got what it takes '
  - Just to make you hurt
  - Don't you see by those big bright eyes
  - Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.
  - Makes no difference where she's been
  - I'm go in south and doin' them things again
  - Bake in a hot tub, down the line
  - I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.
  - I'll go see them come down my way
  - 'Like a fool you''re gonna hear me say:'
  - '"I''ll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown'
  - Please let me love you, baby
  - Don't put me down".

  - I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky,
  - When the children were babies and played on the beach.
  - You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
  - You were always so close and still within reach.
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Whatever made you want to change your mind?
  - Sara, Sara,
  - So easy to look at, so hard to define.
  - I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand,
  - They run to the water their buckets to fill.
  - I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands
  - As they follow each other back up the hill.
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
  - Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night,
  - Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar,
  - Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White,
  - You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
  - Sara, Sara,
  - It's all so clear, I could never forget,
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret.
  - I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells,
  - I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
  - Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
  - Writin' "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Wherever we travel we're never apart.
  - Sara, oh Sara,
  - Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.
  - How did I meet you? I don't know.
  - A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
  - You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
  - And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
  - Sara, oh Sara,
  - Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
  - Sara, Sara,
  - Ya must forgive me my unworthiness.
  - Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
  - And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
  - You always responded when I needed your help,
  - You gave me a map and a key to your door.
  - Sara, oh Sara,
  - Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
  - Sara, oh Sara,
  - Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.

  - As I stepped out of the womb
  - By His grace I have been touched
  - By His word I have been healed
  - By His hand I've been delivered

  - By His truth I can be upright
  - By His strength I do endure
  - By His power I've been lifted
  - In His love I am secure
  - He bought me with a price
  - Freed me from the pit
  - Full of emptiness and wrath
  - And the fire that burns in it
  - I've been saved
  - By the blood of the lamb

  - Nobody to rescue me
  - Nobody would dare
  - I was going down for the last time
  - But by His mercy I've been spared
  - Not by works
  - But by faith in Him who called
  - For so long I've been hindered
  - For so long I've been stalled
  - I've been saved
  - By the blood of the lamb
  - Saved
  - By the blood of the lamb
  - Saved

  - If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
  - Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
  - I've escaped death so many times, I know I'm only living
  - By the saving grace that's over me.
  - By this time I'd-a thought I would be sleeping
  - In a pine box for all eternity.
  - My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
  - For the saving grace that's over me.
  - Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection,
  - Wherever I am welcome is where I'll be.
  - I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
  - Is the saving grace that's over me.
  - Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
  - But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
  - As I look around this world all that I'm finding
  - Is the saving grace that's over me.
  - The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
  - There's only one road and it leads to Calvary.
  - It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
  - By the saving grace that's over me.

  - In Scarlet Town where I was born
  - There's ivy leaf and silver thorn
  - The streets have names that you can't pronounce
  - Gold is down to a quarter an ounce
  - The music starts and the people sway
  - Everybody says, "Are you going my way?"
  - Uncle Tom still working for Uncle Bill
  - Scarlet Town is under the hill
  - Scarlet Town in the month of May
  - Sweet William on his deathbed lay
  - Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
  - Kissing his face, heaping prayers on his head
  - So brave, so true, so gentle is he
  - I'll weep for him as he'd weep for me
  - Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
  - In Scarlet Town where I was born
  - Scarlet Town in the hot noon hours
  - There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
  - Beggars crouching at the gate
  - Help comes but it comes too late
  - On marble slabs and in fields of stone
  - You make your humble wishes known
  - I touched the garment but the hem was torn
  - In Scarlet Town where I was born
  - In Scarlet Town the end is near
  - The seven wonders of the world are here
  - The evil and the good living side by side
  - All human forms seem glorified
  - Put your heart on a platter and see who'll bite
  - See who'll hold you and kiss you good night
  - There's walnut groves and maplewood
  - In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good
  - In Scarlet Town you fight your father's foes
  - Up on the hill a chilly wind blows
  - You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
  - You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
  - You got legs that can drive men mad
  - A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had
  - In Scarlet Town the sky is clear
  - You'll wish to God that you stayed right here
  - Set 'em up Joe, play Walking the Floor
  - Play it for my flat-chested junky whore
  - I'm staying up late, and I'm making amends
  - While the smile from Heaven descends
  - If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
  - All things are beautiful in their time
  - The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
  - It's all right there for ya in Scarlet Town

  - Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not"
  - Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon
  - I can smell the tail of the dragon
  - Can't stand the suspense anymore
  - Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?
  - Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
  - Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
  - A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
  - She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing"
  - Senor, senor, you know their hearts they're as hard as leather
  - Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
  - I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
  - I'm ready when you are, senor

  - Disconnect these cables

  - Old Reilly stole a stallion
  - But they caught him and they brought him back
  - And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
  - With an iron chain around his neck.
  - Old Reilly's daughter got a message
  - That her father was goin' to hang.
  - She rode by night and came by morning
  - With gold and silver in her hand.
  - When the judge he saw Reilly's daughter
  - His old eyes deepened in his head,
  - Sayin', "Gold will never free your father,
  - The price, my dear, is you instead."
  - '"Oh I''m as good as dead," cried Reilly,'
  - '"It''s only you that he does crave'
  - And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
  - Get on your horse and ride away."
  - '"Oh father you will surely die'
  - If I don't take the chance to try
  - And pay the price and not take your advice.
  - For that reason I will have to stay."
  - The gallows shadows shook the evening,
  - In the night a hound dog bayed,
  - In the night the grounds were groanin',
  - In the night the price was paid.
  - The next mornin' she had awoken
  - To find that the judge had never spoken.
  - She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',
  - She saw her father's body broken.
  - 'These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:'
  - That one doctor can not save him,
  - That two healers can not heal him,
  - That three eyes can not see him.
  - That four ears can not hear him,
  - That five walls can not hide him,
  - That six diggers can not bury him
  - And that seven deaths shall never kill him.

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Shelter_From_The_Storm
  - '''Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood'
  - When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
  - I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
  - I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
  - In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
  - Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
  - Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
  - Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
  - Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
  - With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
  - She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
  - I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
  - Just to think that it all began on an noneventful morn
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
  - But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
  - And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
  - And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
  - Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
  - I bargained for salvation an' she gave me a lethal dose
  - I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'
  - Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
  - Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
  - If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
  - '"Come in," she said, "I''ll give you shelter from the storm"'

  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
  - Don't need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
  - Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
  - Don't need a shot of whiskey, help me be president
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
  - I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's makin' me feel afraid
  - What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
  - Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you
  - I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em too
  - Don't show me no picture show or give me no book to read
  - It don't satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that I feed
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - Why would I want to take your life?
  - You've only murdered my father, raped his wife
  - Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
  - Mocked my God, humiliated my friends
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - Don't wanna be with nobody tonight Veronica not here
  - Mavis just ain't right
  - There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth and near
  - Am I supposed to sit back and wait until he's here?
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
  - Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't actin' right
  - Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
  - My conscience is beginning to bother me today
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
  - If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love

  - City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
  - Dressed in holiday style
  - In the air
  - There's a feeling of Christmas
  - Children laughing
  - People passing
  - Meeting smile after smile
  - And on every street corner you'll hear
  - Silver bells, silver bells
  - It's Christmas time in the city
  - Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
  - Soon it will be Christmas day
  - City streetlights
  - Even stop lights
  - Blink a bright red and green
  - As the shoppers rush
  - Home with their treasures
  - Hear the snow crunch
  - See the kids bunch
  - This is Santa's big scene
  - And above all this bustle
  - You'll hear
  - Silver bells, silver bells
  - It's Christmas time in the city
  - Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
  - Soon it will be Christmas day

  - Stake my future on a hell of a past
  - Looks like tomorrow is a coming on fast
  - Ain't complaining about what I got
  - Seen better times but who has not.
  - 'Silvio silver and gold '
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
  - Silvio I gotta go
  - Find out something only dead men know.
  - Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
  - When I come a-knockin' don't throw me no bone
  - I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
  - If you don't like it you can leave me alone.
  - I can snap my fingers and require the rain
  - From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
  - I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
  - And charm the whistle off an evening train.
  - Silvio silver and gold
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
  - Silvio I gotta go
  - 'Find out something only dead men know '
  - Give what I got until I got no more
  - I take what I get until I even the score
  - You know I love you and further more
  - When it is time to go you got an open door.
  - I can tell your fancy I can tell your plain
  - You give something up for everything you gain
  - Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
  - Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
  - 'Silvio silver and gold '
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
  - Silvio I gotta go
  - Find out something only dead men know.
  - One of these days and it won't be long
  - Going down in the valley and sing my song
  - I will sing it loud and sing it strong
  - Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
  - Silvio silver and gold
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
  - 'Silvio I gotta go '
  - Find out something only dead men know.
  - Silvio silver and gold
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
  - 'Silvio I gotta go '
  - Find out something only dead men know.
  - Silvio silver and gold
  - Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold

  - They sat together in the park
  - As the evening sky grew dark
  - She looked at him and he felt a spark
  - Tingle to his bones
  - '''Twas then he felt alone'
  - And wished that he'd gone straight
  - And watched out for a simple twist of fate
  - They walked alone by the old canal
  - A little confused, I remember well
  - And stopped into a strange hotel
  - With a neon burning bright
  - He felt the heat of the night
  - Hit him like a freight-
  - Train moving with a simple twist of fate
  - A saxophone someplace far off played
  - As she was walking on by the arcade
  - As the light bust through a beat up shade
  - Where he was waking up
  - She dropped a coin into the cup
  - Of a blind man at the gate
  - And forgot about a simple twist of fate
  - He woke up; the room was bare
  - He didn't see her anywhere
  - He told himself he didn't care
  - Pushed the window open wide
  - Felt an emptiness inside
  - To which he just could not relate
  - Brought on by a simple twist of fate
  - He hears the ticking of the clocks
  - And walks along with a parrot that talks
  - Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
  - Where the sailors all come in
  - Maybe she'll pick him out again
  - How long must he wait
  - One more time for a simple twist of fate
  - People tell me it's a sin
  - To know and feel too much within
  - I still believe she was my twin
  - But I lost the ring
  - She was born in spring
  - But I was born too late
  - Blame it on a simple twist of fate

  - Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.
  - The lonesome days,

  - Skylark
  - Have you anything to say to me
  - Won't you tell me where my love can be
  - Is there a meadow in the mist
  - Where someone's waiting to be kissed
  - Skylark
  - Have you seen a valley green with spring
  - Where my heart can go a-journeying
  - Over the shadows and the rain
  - To a blossom covered lane
  - And in your lonely flight
  - Haven't you heard the music of the night
  - Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
  - Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon
  - Oh, Skylark
  - I don't know if you can find these things
  - But my heart is riding on your wings
  - So if you see them anywhere
  - Won't you lead me there

  - Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
  - Can't help but wonder what's happenin' to my companions,
  - Are they lost or are they found, have they counted the cost it'll take to bring
  - Down
  - All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
  - There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - I had a woman down in Alabama,
  - She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
  - She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
  - You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
  - There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - All that foreign oil controlling American soil,
  - Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed.
  - Sheiks walkin' around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,
  - Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and to Paris
  - And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - Man's ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don't apply no more,
  - You can't rely no more to be standin' around waitin'
  - In the home of the brave, Jefferson turnin' over in his grave,
  - Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
  - And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters,
  - Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
  - But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
  - All non-believers and men stealers talkin' in the name of religion
  - And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
  - Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it.
  - They say lose your inhibitions, follow your own ambitions,
  - They talk about a life of brotherly love, show me someone who knows how to
  - Live it. There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.
  - Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy
  - A real suicide case, but there was nothin' I could do to stop it,
  - I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy
  - But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets,
  - There's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

  - Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
  - Made before the foundation of the world
  - And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
  - And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.
  - For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
  - For me he was rejected by a world that He created.
  - Nations are angry, cursed are some,
  - People are expecting a false peace to come.
  - Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
  - Made before the foundation of the world
  - And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go
  - And I can't let go, won't let go, and I can't let go no more.
  - It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
  - Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
  - Using all the devices under the sun.
  - And He never give up 'til the battle's lost or won.
  - Well, I'm hangin' on to a solid rock
  - Made before the foundation of the world
  - And I won't let go, and I can't let go, won't let go

  - Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
  - You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
  - And night after night, as strange as it seems
  - The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
  - Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
  - Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
  - Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
  - When you feel her call you across a crowded room
  - Then fly to her side and make her your own
  - Or all through your life you may dream all alone
  - Once that you found her, never let her go
  - Once you have found her, never let her go

  - Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
  - Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair
  - Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
  - Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
  - You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
  - The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file
  - What's your position, baby, what's going on?
  - Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
  - I know everything about this place, or so it seems
  - Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
  - Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
  - What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
  - Something is burning, baby, here's what I say
  - Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today
  - I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue
  - Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
  - We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
  - Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
  - But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
  - Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
  - I can feel it in the night when I think of you
  - I can feel it in the light and it's got to be true
  - You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied
  - You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied
  - Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
  - Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
  - Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
  - Just what in the world has come over you?
  - I can feel it in the wind and it's upside down
  - I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
  - I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
  - I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain't what you deserve
  - Something is burning, baby, something's in flames
  - There's a man going 'round calling names
  - Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you
  - I believe in the impossible, you know that I do

  - Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
  - Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
  - Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
  - Somethin' that crossed over from another century?
  - Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
  - Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin' the hills of old Duluth
  - There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
  - Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth
  - Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
  - Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things
  - I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
  - But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death
  - Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
  - I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place
  - My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton
  - Somethin' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on

  - Somewhere along the way?
  - The friends we used to know
  - Would always smile, "Hello"
  - No love like our love they'd say
  - Then love slipped through our fingers
  - Somewhere along the way
  - I should forget
  - But with the loneliness of night
  - I start remembering ev'rything
  - You're gone and yet
  - There's still a feeling deep inside
  - That you will always be part of me
  - So now I look for you
  - Along the avenue
  - And as I wander I pray
  - That some day soon I'll find you
  - Somewhere along the way
  - That some day soon I'll find you

  - I'm seein' your world of people and things,
  - Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
  - Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
  - '''Bout a funny ol'' world that''s a-comin'' along.'
  - Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
  - It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born.
  - Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
  - All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more.
  - I'm a-singin' you this song, but I can't sing enough,
  - '''Cause there''s not many men that done the things that you''ve done.'
  - Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too,
  - An' to all the good people that traveled with you.
  - Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
  - That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
  - I'm a-leavin' tomorrow, but I could leave today,
  - Somewhere down the road someday.
  - The very last thing that I'd want to do
  - Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too.

  - I've faced stronger walls than yours
  - Charlotte's a harlot
  - Dresses in scarlet
  - Mary dresses in green
  - It's soon after midnight
  - And I've got a date with the fairy queen
  - They chirp and they chatter
  - What does it matter?
  - They lie and dine in their blood
  - Two-timing Slim
  - Who's every heard of him?
  - I'll drag his corpse through the mud

  - Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
  - And your flashing diamond teeth
  - The night is pitch black, come and make my
  - Pale face fit into place, oh, please
  - Let me know, babe, I'm nearly drowning
  - If it's you my lifelines trace
  - I've been wondering all about me
  - Ever since I seen you there
  - On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding
  - I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where

  - When you're with me
  - I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
  - What does it matter
  - What price I pay
  - They brag about your sugar
  - Brag about it all over town
  - Put some sugar in my bowl
  - I feel like laying down
  - I'm as pale as a ghost
  - Holding a blossom on a stem
  - You ever seen a ghost? No
  - But you have heard of them
  - I see you there
  - I'm blinded by the colors I see
  - I take good care
  - Of what belongs to me
  - I hear your name
  - Ringing up and down the line
  - I'm saying it plain
  - These ties are strong enough to bind
  - Now your sweet voice
  - Calls out from some old familiar shrine
  - I got no choice
  - Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
  - I could live forever
  - With you perfectly
  - You don't ever
  - Have to make a fuss over me
  - From East to West
  - Ever since the world began
  - I only mean it for the best
  - I want to be with you any way I can
  - I been in a brawl
  - Now I'm feeling the wall
  - I'm going away baby
  - I won't be back till fall
  - High on the hill
  - You can carry all my thoughts with you
  - You've numbed my will
  - This love could tear me in two
  - I wanna be with you in paradise
  - And it seems so unfair
  - I can't go to paradise no more
  - I killed a man back there
  - You think I'm over the hill
  - You think I'm past my prime
  - Let me see what you got
  - We can have a whoppin' good time

  - Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night
  - Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat
  - Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer
  - Turned around to Billy Lyons, said "What you doin' here?"
  - '"Waitin'' for a train to bring my woman home"'
  - '"Stack-A-Lee, oh Stack-A-Lee please don''t take my life'
  - Got three little children and a weepin', loving wife
  - You're a bad man, bad man Stack-A-Lee"
  - '"God bless your children and I''ll take care of your wife'
  - You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life"
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat
  - Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and shot him right through the head
  - Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat
  - Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come
  - Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?"
  - You're a bad man, bad man Stack-A-Lee
  - Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
  - Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat
  - Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark
  - It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark
  - He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail
  - High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep
  - High police catched Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet
  - He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail
  - Well they got old Stack-A-Lee, and they led him right back in jail
  - Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A-Lee's bail
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat
  - Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said "Jailer, I can't sleep
  - '''Round my bedside Billy Lyons begin to creep"'
  - All about that John B. Stetson Hat

  - I've been walking through the summer nights
  - The jukebox playing low
  - Yesterday everything was going too fast
  - Today it's moving too slow
  - I've got no place left to turn
  - I've got nothing left to burn
  - Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
  - It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
  - You left me standing in the doorway crying
  - I got nothing to go back to now
  - The light in this place is so bad
  - Making me sick in the head
  - All the laughter is just making me sad
  - The stars have turned cherry red
  - I'm strumming on my gay guitar
  - Smoking a cheap cigar
  - The ghost of my old love has not gone away
  - Don't looking like it will any time soon
  - You left me standing in the doorway crying
  - Under the midnight moon
  - Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
  - But not tonight and it won't be here
  - 'There are things I could say, but I don''t '
  - I know the mercy of God must be near
  - I been riding a midnight train
  - Got ice water in my veins
  - I would be crazy if I took you back
  - It would go up against every rule
  - You left me standing in the doorway crying
  - Suffering like a fool
  - When the last rays of daylight go down
  - 'Buddy, you''ll roll no more '
  - I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
  - I wonder who they're ringing for
  - I know I can't win
  - But my heart just won't give in
  - Last night I danced with a stranger
  - But she just reminded me you were the one
  - 'You left me standing in the doorway crying '
  - In the dark land of the sun
  - I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
  - And live my life on the square
  - And even if the flesh falls off of my face
  - I know someone will be there to care
  - It always means so much
  - Even the softest touch
  - I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
  - There's no words that need to be said
  - You left me standing in the doorway crying
  - Blues wrapped around my head

  - Sometimes I wonder why I spend
  - My lonely nights dreamin' of a song
  - The melody haunts my reverie
  - And I am once again with you
  - When our love was new
  - And each kiss an inspiration
  - Oh, but that was long ago
  - And now my consolation
  - Is in the stardust of a song
  - Beside a garden wall
  - When stars were bright
  - You were in my arms
  - The nightingale told its fairytale
  - Of paradise where roses bloom
  - Though I dream in vain
  - In my heart it'll always remain
  - My stardust melody
  - The memory of love's refrain

  - Should my heart not be humble
  - Should my eyes fail to see
  - Should my feet sometimes stumble
  - On the way, stay with me
  - Like the lamb that in springtime
  - Wanders far from the fold
  - Comes the darkness and the frost
  - I get lost
  - I grow cold
  - I grow cold, I grow weary
  - And I know I have sinned
  - And I go, seeking shelter
  - And I cry in the wind
  - Though I grope and I blunder
  - And I'm weak and I'm wrong
  - Though the road buckles under
  - Where I walk, walk along
  - Till I find to my wonder
  - Every path leads to Thee
  - All that I can do is pray
  - Stay with me
  - Stay with me

  - Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
  - Stormy weather, just can't get my poor old self together
  - I'm weary all the time, the time
  - So weary all of the time
  - When she went away the blues walked in and met me
  - If she stays away that old rocking chair's bound to get me
  - All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
  - A-just walk in that sun once more
  - Can't go on, everything I had is gone

  - Ah, the rag man draws circles up and down the block
  - I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk
  - And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape
  - But deep inside my heart, I know I can't escape
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
  - Speaking to some French girl who says she knows me well
  - And I would send a message to find out if she's talked
  - But the post office has been stolen and the mailbox is locked
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line
  - She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine
  - And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again, there's only one I've met
  - And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette"
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks
  - But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked
  - But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
  - When he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Now the senator came down here, showing everyone his gun
  - Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son
  - And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck
  - To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
  - Oh, mama
  - Is this really the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Now the teen preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
  - With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest
  - But he cursed me when I proved to him, then I whispered, said "Not even you can
    hide
  - You see, you're just like me, I hope you're satisfied"
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Now the rain man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in"
  - The one was Texas medicine, the other was just railroad gin
  - And like a fool, I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind
  - And now people just get uglier, and I have no sense of time
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - When Ruthie says come see her in honky-tonk lagoon
  - Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon
  - And I say, "Ah, come on now, you know about my debutante"
  - And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want"
  - Oh, mama
  - Can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?
  - Now the bricks lay on Grand Street where the neon madmen climb
  - They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well-timed
  - And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price
  - You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice
  - Oh, mama
  - Is this really the end?
  - To be stuck here inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again?

  - Twenty years of schoolin'

  - Sugar baby get on down the road
  - You ain't got no brains nohow
  - You went years without me

  - Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
  - Plenty of places to hide things here if you want to hide them bad enough

  - Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
  - Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
  - Any minute of the day, the bubble could burst

  - You got a way of tearin' a world apart, love, see what you've done
  - Just as sure as we're livin', just as sure as you're born
  - Look up, look up, seek your Maker, 'fore Gabriel blows his horn

  - He gone North, for a while
  - They say that vanity got the best of him
  - But he sure left here in style
  - By the way, that's a cute hat
  - And a smile so hard to resist
  - What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
  - You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
  - She wanted a whole man, not just a half
  - She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
  - You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
  - In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
  - It's done with a flick of the wrist
  - What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
  - You know, a woman like you should be at home
  - That's where you belong
  - Taking care of somebody nice
  - Who don't know how to do you wrong
  - Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
  - Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss
  - What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
  - You know you can make a name for yourself
  - You can hear them tires squeal
  - You could be known as the most beautiful woman
  - Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal
  - You know, news of you has come down the line
  - Even before ya came in the door
  - They say in your father's house, there's many mansions
  - Each one of them got a fireproof floor
  - Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
  - They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
  - What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?
  - Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
  - Got to have done some evil deed
  - Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
  - Got to play your harp until your lips bleed
  - They say that patriotism is the last refuge
  - To which a scoundrel clings
  - Steal a little and they throw you in jail
  - Steal a lot and they make you king
  - There's only one step down from here, baby
  - It's called the land of permanent bliss
  - What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

  - One time in London I'd gone out for a walk,
  - Past a place called Hyde park where people talk
  - '''Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view'
  - To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
  - There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
  - About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
  - '"It''s too bright a light", he said, "For anybody''s eyes,'
  - If you've never seen one it's a blessing in disguise."
  - I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
  - Two men in front of me were coming to blows
  - The man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
  - Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
  - '"The news of the day is on all the time,'
  - All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme,
  - Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
  - Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
  - '"Pray for peace!". he said, you could feel it in the crowd.'
  - My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud,
  - '"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone'
  - No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
  - '"It will led you into some strange pursuits,'
  - Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
  - It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about,
  - Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
  - '"It''s all been designed", he said, "To make you lose your mind,'
  - And when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find."
  - '"Everytime you look at it, your situation''s worse,'
  - If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
  - The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
  - There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran.
  - The TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me,
  - Later on that evening, I watched it on TV

  - These are the words of a frontier man
  - Who lost his love when he turned bad
  - Take a message to Mary
  - But don't tell here where I am
  - Take a message to Mary
  - But don't say I'm in a jam
  - You can tell her that I had to see the world
  - Tell her that my ship set sail
  - You can say she'd better not wait for me
  - But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail
  - Take a message to Mary
  - But don't tell her what I've done
  - Please, don't mention the stage coach
  - And the shot from a carried gun
  - You better tell her that I had to change my plans
  - And cancel out the wedding-day
  - But please, don't mention the lonely cell
  - Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day
  - Take a message to Mary
  - But don't tell her all you know
  - My heart is aching for Mary
  - Lord know I miss her so
  - Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu
  - Tell her I'm searching for gold
  - You can say she better find someone new
  - To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold

  - Why must you always try to make me over?
  - Take me as I am or let me go
  - White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
  - Take me as I am or let me go.
  - You're trying to reshape me in a moment
  - In the image of someone you used to know
  - I won't be a stand-in for an old love
  - Take me as I am or let me go.
  - You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
  - Take me as I am or let me go.
  - If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
  - Take me as I am or let me go.
  - You're trying to reshape me in a mould love
  - In the image of someone you used to know
  - But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
  - Take me as I am or let me go.

  - I saw it advertised one day
  - Bear Mountain picnic was comin' my way
  - '"Come along ''n'' take a trip'
  - We'll bring you up there on a ship
  - Bring the wife and kids
  - Bring the whole family."
  - Yippee!
  - Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
  - To this Bear Mountain Picnic
  - But little did I realize
  - I was in for a picnic surprise
  - Had nothin' to do with mountains
  - I didn't even come close to a bear
  - Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier
  - Six thousand people there
  - Everybody had ticket for the trip
  - '"Oh well." I said, "it''s a pretty big ship'
  - Besides, anyway, the more the merrier."
  - Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think
  - That big old boat started t' sink
  - More people kept a-pilin' on
  - That old ship was a-slowly goin' down
  - Funny way t' start a picnic
  - Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife
  - So many people there I never saw in m' life
  - That old ship sinkin' down in the water
  - Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other
  - Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin'
  - Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin'
  - Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'
  - Maybe we just better call off the picnic
  - I got shoved down 'n' pushed around
  - All I could hear there was a screamin' sound
  - Don't remember one thing more
  - Just remember walkin' up on a little shore
  - Head busted, stomach cracked
  - Feet splintered, I was bald, naked...
  - Quite lucky to be alive though
  - Feelin' like I climbed outa m' casket
  - I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket
  - Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home
  - Wishin' I'd never got up that morn
  - Now, I don't care just what you do
  - If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you
  - But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it
  - '''Cause, see, I just lost all m'' picnic spirit'
  - Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic...
  - In the bathroom
  - Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
  - What some people are gonna do f'r money
  - There's a bran' new gimmick every day
  - Just t' take somebody's money away
  - I think we oughta take some o' these people
  - And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain...
  - For a picnic

  - Well, I was feelin' sad and feelin' blue,
  - I didn't know what in the world I was gonna do,
  - Them Communists, they was comin' around,
  - They was in the air,
  - They was on the ground.
  - They wouldn't gimme no peace...
  - So I run down most hurriedly
  - And joined up with the John Birch Society,
  - I got me a secret membership card
  - And started off a-walkin' down the road.
  - Yee-hoo, I'm a real John Bircher now!
  - Look out you Commies!
  - Now we all agree with Hitler's views,
  - Although he killed six million Jews.
  - It don't matter too much that he was a Fascist,
  - At least you can't say he was a Communist!
  - That's to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria.
  - Well, I was lookin' everywhere for them gol-darned Reds.
  - I got up in the mornin' 'n' looked under my bed,
  - Looked in the sink, behind the door,
  - Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
  - Couldn't find 'em ...
  - I was lookin' high an' low for them Reds everywhere,
  - I was lookin' in the sink an' underneath the chair.
  - I looked way up my chimney hole,
  - I even looked deep inside my toilet bowl.
  - They got away ...
  - Well, I was sittin' home alone an' started to sweat,
  - Figured they was in my TV set.
  - Peeked behind the picture frame,
  - Got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.
  - Them Reds caused it!
  - I know they did ... them hard-core ones.
  - Well, I quit my job so I could work alone,
  - Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes.
  - Followed some clues from my detective bag
  - And discovered they was red stripes on the American flag!
  - That ol' Betty Ross ...
  - Well, I investigated all the books in the library,
  - Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
  - I investigated all the people that I knowed,
  - Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.
  - The other two percent are fellow Birchers ... just like me.
  - Now Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
  - Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
  - To my knowledge there's just one man
  - 'That''s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell.'
  - I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
  - Well, I finally started thinkin' straight
  - When I run outa things to investigate.
  - Couldn't imagine doin' anything else,
  - So now I'm sittin' home investigatin' myself!
  - Hope I don't find out anything ... hmm, great God!

  - Ramblin' out of the wild West
  - Leavin' the towns I love the best
  - Thought I'd seen some ups and down
  - '''Til I come into New York town'
  - People goin' down to the ground
  - Buildings goin' up to the sky
  - Wintertime in New York town
  - The wind blowin' snow around
  - Walk around with nowhere to go
  - Somebody could freeze right to the bone
  - I froze right to the bone
  - New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
  - I didn't feel so cold then
  - I swung on to my old guitar
  - Grabbed hold of a subway car
  - And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
  - I landed up on the downtown side
  - Greenwich Village
  - I walked down there and ended up
  - In one of them coffeehouses on the block
  - I get on the the stage to sing and play
  - 'Man there said: Come back some other day'
  - 'You sound like a hillbilly '
  - We want folk singers here
  - Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
  - Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day
  - I blowed inside out and upside down
  - The man there said he loved m'sound
  - He was ravin' about how he loved my sound
  - Dollar a day's worth
  - And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around
  - I finally got a job in New York town
  - In a bigger place, bigger money, too
  - Even joined the union and paid my dues
  - Now, a very great man once said
  - That some people rob you with a fountain pen
  - It don't take too long to find out
  - Just what he was talkin' about
  - A lot of people don't have much food on their table
  - But they got a lot of forks and knives
  - And they gotta cut somethin'
  - So one mornin', when the sun was warm
  - I rambled out of New York town
  - Pulled my cap down over my eyes
  - And headed out for the western skies
  - So long, New York
  - Howdy, East Orange

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Talkin%27_World_War_III_Blues
  - One time ago a crazy dream came to me
  - I dreamt I was walkin' into World War III
  - Went to the doctor the very next day
  - To see what kinda words he could say, said it was a bad dream
  - '"I wouldn''t worry ''bout it none, though, them old dreams are only in your head"'
  - I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain"
  - He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane"
  - He grabbed my arm, I said, "Ouch"
  - As I landed on the psychiatric couch, said, "Tell me about it"
  - Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast
  - It was all over by quarter past
  - I was down in the sewer with some little lover
  - When I peeked out from a manhole cover
  - Wonderin' who turned the lights on us
  - Well, I got up and walked around
  - Up and down the lonesome town
  - I stood a-wondering which way to go
  - I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
  - It was a normal day
  - Well, I rung me a fallout shelter bell
  - And I leaned my head and I give a yell
  - '"Gimme a string bean, I''m a hungry man"'
  - A shotgun fired and away I ran
  - I don't blame them too much though, they didn't know me
  - Down the corner by the hot-dog stand, I seen a man
  - I said, "Howdy friend, I guess it's just us two"
  - He screamed a bit and away he flew
  - Thought I was a communist
  - Well I spied a girl and before she could leave
  - I said, "Let's go and play Adam and Eve"
  - I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
  - She said, "Hey man, you crazy or somethin'?
  - You see what happened last time they started"
  - Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
  - There was nobody around
  - I got into the driver's seat
  - And I drove 42nd Street in my Cadillac
  - Good car to drive after a war
  - Well, I remember seein' some ad
  - So I turned on my Conelrad
  - But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
  - So the radio didn't work so well
  - Turned on my record-player
  - It was "Rock-A-Day Johnny," singing
  - '"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa'
  - Our Love's a-Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah"
  - I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue
  - And I needed somebody to talk to
  - So I called up the operator of time
  - Just to hear a voice of some kind
  - '"When you hear the beep, it will be three o''clock"'
  - She said that for over an hour and I hung up
  - Well the doctor interrupted me just about then
  - Sayin', "Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams
  - But mine was a little different, you see
  - I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
  - I didn't see you around"
  - Well, now time passed and now it seems everybody's having them dreams
  - Everybody sees theirself
  - Walkin' around with no one else
  - Half of the people can be part-right all of the time
  - Some of the people can be all right part of the time
  - But all the people can't be all right all the time
  - I think Abraham Lincoln said that
  - '"I''ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours," I said that'

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Tangled_Up_In_Blue
  - Early one morning, the sun was shining
  - I was laying in bed
  - Wondering if she'd changed it all
  - If her hair was still red
  - Her folks, they said our lives together
  - Sure was gonna be rough
  - They never did like mama's homemade dress
  - Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
  - And I was standing on the side of the road
  - Rain falling on my shoes
  - Heading out for the east coast
  - Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
  - Tangled up in blue
  - She was married when we first met
  - Soon to be divorced
  - I helped her out of a jam, I guess
  - But I used a little too much force
  - We drove that car as far as we could
  - Abandoned it out west
  - Split up on a dark, sad night
  - Both agreeing it was best
  - She turned around to look at me
  - As I was walking away
  - I heard her say over my shoulder
  - '"We''ll meet again someday on the avenue"'
  - Tangled up in blue
  - I had a job in the great north woods
  - Working as a cook for a spell
  - But I never did like it all that much
  - And one day the axe just fell
  - So I drifted down to New Orleans
  - Where I's lucky for to be employed
  - Working for a while on a fishing boat
  - Right outside of Delacroix
  - But all the while I was alone
  - The past was close behind
  - I seen a lot of women
  - But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
  - Tangled up in blue
  - She was working in a topless place
  - And I stopped in for a beer
  - I just kept looking at the sight of her face
  - In the spotlight so clear
  - And later on when the crowd thinned out
  - I's just about to do the same
  - She was standing there in back of my chair
  - Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
  - I muttered something underneath my breath
  - She studied the lines on my face
  - I must admit I felt a little uneasy
  - When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
  - Tangled up in blue
  - She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
  - '"I thought you''d never say hello," she said'
  - '"You look like the silent type"'
  - Then she opened up a book of poems
  - And handed it to me
  - Written by an Italian poet
  - From the thirteenth century
  - And every one of them words rang true
  - And glowed like burning coal
  - Pouring off of every page
  - Like it was written in my soul from me to you
  - Tangled up in blue
  - I lived with them on Montague Street
  - In a basement down the stairs
  - "There was music in the caf\xE9s at night"
  - And revolution in the air
  - Then he started into dealing with slaves
  - And something inside of him died
  - She had to sell everything she owned
  - And froze up inside
  - And when finally the bottom fell out
  - I became withdrawn
  - The only thing I knew how to do
  - Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
  - Tangled up in blue
  - So now I'm going back again
  - I got to get her somehow
  - All the people we used to know
  - They're an illusion to me now
  - Some are mathematicians
  - Some are carpenter's wives
  - Don't know how it all got started
  - I don't what they do with their lives
  - But me, I'm still on the road
  - Heading for another joint
  - We always did feel the same
  - We just saw it from a different point of view
  - Tangled up in blue

  - I buyed me a little dog, color it was brown
  - I learned him to whistle, sing and dance and run.
  - His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears they were quite broad
  - Around the world in half a day and on him I could ride.
  - Sing taddle o day.
  - I buyed me a little bull about four inches high
  - Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry
  - When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound,
  - Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground.
  - Sing taddle o day.
  - I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers
  - Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers.
  - I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase
  - For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese,
  - Sing taddle o day.
  - I buyed me a little box about four acres square
  - I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair
  - Oh now I'm bound for Turkey, I'll travel like an ox
  - In my breeches pocket, I'll carry my little box
  - Sing taddle o day.
  - I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair
  - I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare
  - The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high
  - And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie
  - Sing taddle o day.

  - We carried you in our arms
  - On Independence Day
  - And now you throw us all aside
  - And put us on our way.
  - Oh, what dear daughter would 'neath the sun
  - Would treat a father so?
  - To wait upon him hand and foot
  - Yet always answer, "No"?
  - Tears of rage, tears of grief
  - Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
  - Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
  - And life is brief.
  - It was all pointed out the way to go
  - And scratched your name in sand,
  - Though you just thought that it was nothing more
  - Than a place for you to stand.
  - Now, I want you to know that while you watched,
  - You discovered there was no one true.
  - That I myself really thought
  - It was just a childish thing to do.
  - Tears of rage, tears of grief
  - Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
  - Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
  - And life is brief.
  - It was all very, very painless
  - When you ran out to receive
  - All that false instruction
  - Which we never could believe.
  - And now the heart is filled with gold
  - As if it was a purse.
  - But, oh, what kind of love is this
  - Which goes from bad to worse?
  - Tears of rage, tears of grief
  - Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
  - Come to me now, you know, we're so alone
  - And life is brief.

  - The pale moon rose in its glory
  - Out on the Western town
  - She told a sad, sad story
  - Of the great ship that went down
  - T'was the fourteenth day of April
  - Over the waves she rode
  - Sailing into tomorrow
  - To a golden age foretold
  - The night was black with starlight
  - The seas were sharp and clear
  - Moving through the shadows
  - The promised hour was near
  - Lights were holding steady
  - Gliding over the foam
  - All the lords and ladies
  - Heading for their eternal home
  - The chandeliers were swaying
  - From the balustrades above
  - The orchestra was playing
  - Songs of faded love
  - The watchman, he lay dreaming
  - As the ballroom dancers twirled
  - He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
  - Into the underworld
  - Leo took his sketchbook
  - He was often so inclined
  - He closed his eyes and painted
  - The scenery in his mind
  - Cupid struck his bosom
  - And broke it with a snap
  - The closest woman to him
  - He fell into her lap
  - He heard a loud commotion
  - Something sounded wrong
  - His inner spirit was saying
  - That he couldn't stand here long
  - He staggered to the quarterdeck
  - No time now to sleep
  - Water on the quarterdeck
  - Already three foot deep
  - Smokestack was leaning sideways
  - Heavy feet began to pound
  - He walked into the whirlwind
  - The sky splitting all around
  - The ship was going under
  - The universe had opened wide
  - The roll was called up yonder
  - The angels turned aside
  - Lights down in the hallway
  - Flickering dim and dull
  - Dead bodies already floating
  - In the double bottom hull
  - The engines then exploded
  - Propellers they failed to start
  - The boilers overloaded
  - The ship's bow split apart
  - Passengers were flying
  - Backward, forward, far and fast
  - They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
  - Each one more weary than the last
  - The veil was torn asunder
  - '''Tween the hours of twelve and one'
  - No change, no sudden wonder
  - Could undo what had been done
  - The watchman lay there dreaming
  - At fourtyfive degrees
  - He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
  - Dropping to her knees
  - Wellington he was sleeping
  - His bed began to slide
  - His valiant heart was beating
  - He pushed the tables aside
  - Glass of shattered crystal
  - Lay scattered roundabout
  - He strapped on both his pistols
  - How long could he hold out?
  - His men and his companions
  - Were nowhere to be seen
  - In silence there he waited for
  - Time and space to intervene
  - The passageway was narrow
  - There was blackness in the air
  - He saw every kind of sorrow
  - Heard voices everywhere
  - Alarm-bells were ringing
  - To hold back the swelling tide
  - Friends and lovers clinging
  - To each other side by side
  - Mothers and their daughters
  - Descending down the stairs
  - Jumped into the icy waters
  - Love and pity sent their prayers
  - The rich man, Mister Astor
  - Kissed his darling wife
  - He had no way of knowing
  - It'd be the last trip of his life
  - Calvin, Blake and Wilson
  - Gambled in the dark
  - Not one of them would ever live to
  - Tell the tale on the disembark
  - Brother rose up 'gainst brother
  - In every circumstance
  - They fought and slaughtered each other
  - In a deadly dance
  - They lowered down the lifeboats
  - From the sinking wreck
  - There were traitors, there were turncoats
  - Broken backs and broken necks
  - The bishop left his cabin
  - To help others in need
  - Turned his eyes up to the heavens
  - Said, "The poor are yours to feed"
  - Davey the brothel-keeper
  - Came out dismissed his girls
  - Saw the water getting deeper
  - Saw the changing of his world
  - Jim Dandy smiled
  - He never learned to swim
  - Saw the little crippled child
  - And he gave his seat to him
  - He saw the starlight shining
  - Streaming from the East
  - Death was on the rampage
  - But his heart was now at peace
  - They battened down the hatches
  - But the hatches wouldn't hold
  - They drowned upon the staircase
  - Of brass and polished gold
  - Leo said to Cleo
  - I think I'm going mad
  - But he'd lost his mind already
  - Whatever mind he had
  - He tried to block the doorway
  - To save all those from harm
  - Blood from an open wound
  - Pouring down his arm
  - Petals fell from flowers
  - '''Til all of them were gone'
  - In the long and dreadful hours
  - The wizard's curse played on
  - The host was pouring brandy
  - He was going down slow
  - He stayed right to the end and he
  - Was the last to go
  - There were many, many others
  - Nameless here forever more
  - They never sailed the ocean
  - Or left their homes before
  - The watchman, he lay dreaming
  - The damage had been done
  - He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
  - And he tried to tell someone
  - The captain, barely breathing
  - Kneeling at the wheel
  - Above him and beneath him
  - Fifty thousand tons of steel
  - He looked over at his compass
  - And he gazed into its face
  - Needle pointing downward
  - He knew he lost the race
  - In the dark illumination
  - He remembered bygone years
  - He read the Book of Revelation
  - And he filled his cup with tears
  - When the Reaper's task had ended
  - Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
  - The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
  - The loveliest and the best
  - They waited at the landing
  - And they tried to understand
  - But there is no understanding
  - On the judgement of God's hand
  - The news came over the wires
  - And struck with deadly force
  - Love had lost its fires
  - All things had run their course
  - The watchman he lay dreaming
  - Of all the things that can be
  - He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
  - Into the deep blue sea

  - Standing on your window, honey, yes, I've been here before
  - Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door
  - How come you don't send me no regards?
  - You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard?
  - Kneeling 'neath your ceiling, yes, I guess I've been here for a while
  - I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child
  - How come you send someone out to have me barred?
  - You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard?
  - Like a poor fool in his prime
  - Yes, I know you can hear me walk
  - But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
  - Or is it just solid rock?
  - Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door
  - I watch upon your scorpion who crawls across your circus floor
  - Just what do you think you have to guard?
  - You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard
  - Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag
  - He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry, like a man in drag
  - How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
  - You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard

  - That old black magic has weaved its spell
  - That old black magic that you weave so well
  - Those icy fingers up and down my spine
  - Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
  - Same old tingle that I feel inside
  - And then that elevator starts its ride
  - And down and down I go, round and round I go
  - Like a leaf caught in the tide
  - I should stay away but what can I do?
  - I hear your name and I'm aflame
  - Aflame with burning desire
  - That only your kiss can put out the fire
  - You're the lover I have waited for
  - You're the mate that fate had me created for
  - And every time your lips meet mine
  - Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
  - In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - Under that old black magic called love
  - In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - Under that old black magic called love
  - In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - Under that old black magic called love
  - I should stay away but what can I do?
  - I hear your name and I'm aflame
  - Aflame with burning desire
  - That only your kiss can put out the fire
  - For you're the lover I have waited for
  - You're the mate that fate had me created for
  - And every time your lips meet mine
  - Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
  - In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - I'm under that old black magic called love
  - Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - Under that old black magic called love
  - In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
  - Under that old black magic called love
  - Under that old black magic called love

  - I saw you last night and got that old feeling
  - When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
  - The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
  - And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
  - Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
  - And I knew the spark of love was still burning
  - There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
  - For that old, old feeling is still in my heart
  - There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
  - For that old, old feeling is still in my heart

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Ballad_Of_Donald_White
  - My name is Donald White, you see
  - I stand before you all
  - I was judged by you a murderer
  - And the hangman's knot must fall
  - I will die upon the gallows pole
  - When the moon is shining clear
  - And these are my final words
  - That you will ever hear
  - I left my home in Kansas
  - When I was very young
  - I landed in the old Northwest
  - Seattle, Washington
  - Although I'd a-traveled many miles
  - I never made a friend
  - For I could never get along in life
  - With people that I met
  - If I had some education
  - To give me a decent start
  - I might have been a doctor or
  - A master in the arts
  - But I used my hands for stealing
  - When I was very young
  - And they locked me down in jailhouse cells
  - That's how my life begun
  - Oh, the inmates and the prisoners
  - I found they were my kind
  - And it was there inside the bars
  - I found my peace of mind
  - But the jails they were too crowded
  - Institutions overflowed
  - So they turned me loose to walk upon
  - Life's hurried tangled road
  - And there's danger on the ocean
  - Where the salt sea waves split high
  - And there's danger on the battlefield
  - Where the shells of bullets fly
  - And there's danger in this open world
  - Where men strive to be free
  - And for me the greatest danger
  - Was in society
  - So I asked them to send me back
  - To the institution home
  - But they said they were too crowded
  - For me they had no room
  - I got down on my knees and begged
  - '''Oh, please put me away,'''
  - But they would not listen to my plea
  - Or nothing I would say
  - And so it was on Christmas eve
  - In the year of '59
  - It was on that night I killed a man
  - I did not try to hide
  - The jury found me guilty
  - And I won't disagree
  - For I knew that it would happen
  - If I wasn't put away
  - And I'm glad I've had no parents
  - To care for me or cry
  - For now they will never know
  - The horrible death I die
  - And I'm also glad I've had no friends
  - To see me in disgrace
  - For they'll never see that hangman's hood
  - Wrap around my face
  - Farewell unto the old north woods
  - Of which I used to roam
  - Farewell unto the crowded bars
  - Of which've been my home
  - Farewell to all you people
  - Who think the worst of me
  - I guess you'll feel much better when
  - I'm on that hanging tree
  - But there's just one question
  - Before they kill me dead
  - I'm wondering just how much
  - To you I really said
  - Concerning all the boys that come
  - Down a road like me
  - Are they enemies or victims
  - Of your society?

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Ballad_Of_Frankie_Lee_And_Judas_Priest
  - Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends
  - So when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
  - And placed them on a footstool just above the potted plain
  - Sayin', "Take your pick, Frankie Boy, my loss will be your gain"
  - Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin
  - But with the cold eyes of Judas on him, his head began to spin
  - '"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "it''s just my foolish
    pride'
  - But sometimes a man must be alone, and this is no place to hide"
  - Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here
  - But you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they
    all disappear"
  - '"I''m gonna start my pickin'' right now, just tell me where you''ll be"'
  - Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity"
  - '"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee, with a voice as cold as ice'
  - '"That''s right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise"'
  - '"I don''t call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile'
  - '"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I''ll see you after a while"'
  - Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feelin' low and mean
  - When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene
  - Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee the gambler, whose father's deceased?
  - Well, if you are, there's a fellow callin' you down the road and they say his
    name is Priest"
  - '"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright'
  - '"I do recall him very well, in fact he just left my sight"'
  - '"Yes, that''s the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse'
  - '"Oh, my message is he''s down the road, stranded in a house"'
  - Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked, he dropped everything and ran
  - Until he came unto the spot where Judas Priest did stand
  - '"What kind of house is this," he said, "Where I have come to roam?"'
  - '"It''s not a house," says Judas Priest, "it''s not a house, it''s a home"'
  - Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled, he soon lost all control
  - Over everything which he had made while the mission bells did toll
  - He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
  - With four and twenty windows and a woman's face in every one
  - Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
  - And foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep
  - For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
  - Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst
  - No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest
  - Except, of course, the little neighbor boy who carried him to rest
  - And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
  - And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed"
  - Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
  - Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong
  - So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin', help him with his load
  - And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Ballad_Of_Ira_Hayes
  - Gather round me people and a story I will tell
  - About a brave young Indian you should remember well
  - From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
  - They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
  - Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
  - Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
  - Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds
  - But when war came he volunteers and forgot the white man's greed
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
  - They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
  - But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
  - And when the fight was over and the Old Glory raised
  - One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
  - He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
  - But he was just a Pima Indian, no money, no crops, no chance
  - And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the when did the Indian's dance
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
  - They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
  - He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
  - Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
  - And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
  - Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
  - Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
  - Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

  - You came along and everything started to hum
  - Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come
  - The best is yet to come and, babe, won't that be fine?
  - You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine
  - Wait till the warm-up's underway
  - Wait till our lips have met
  - And wait till you see that sunshine day
  - You ain't seen nothin' yet
  - The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
  - The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
  - Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
  - We've only tasted the wine
  - We're gonna drain the cup dry
  - Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
  - You think you've flown before but baby you ain't left the ground
  - Wait till you're locked in my embrace
  - Wait till I draw you near
  - Wait till you see that sunshine place
  - Ain't nothin' like it here
  - The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
  - The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
  - Come the day you're mine, and you're gon' be mine

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Boxer
  - I am just a poor boy
  - Though my story's seldom told
  - I have squandered my resistance
  - For a pocketful of mumbles
  - Such are promises, all lies and jest
  - Still a man hears what he wants to hear
  - And disregards the rest.
  - When I left my home and family
  - I was no more than a boy
  - In the company of strangers
  - In the quiet of the railway station
  - Running scared, laying low
  - Seeking out the poorer quarters
  - Where the ragged people go
  - Looking for the places only they would know.
  - Asking only workman's wages
  - I come looking for a job
  - But I get no offers
  - Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
  - I do declare
  - There were times when I was so lonesome
  - I took some comfort there.
  - Now the years go rushing by me
  - They are rocking evenly
  - 'I am older than I once was, '
  - 'But I''m younger than I''ll be, that''s not unusual. '
  - No it isn't strange.
  - After changes upon changes we are more, or less the same.
  - After changes we are more, or less the same.
  - Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
  - And wishing I was gone, going home
  - Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
  - Leading me
  - Going home.
  - In the clearing stands a boxer
  - And a fighter by his trade
  - And he carries the reminders
  - Of every glove that laid him down
  - And cut him till he cried out
  - In his anger and his shame
  - '"I am leaving, I am leaving"'
  - But the fighter still remains.

  - But what's the use of stopping
  - When there's no one on your list
  - You'll know the way I'm feeling
  - When you love and you lose
  - I guess I've got the Christmas blues
  - When somebody wants you
  - Somebody needs you
  - Christmas is a joy of joy
  - But friends when you're lonely
  - You'll find that it's only
  - A thing for little girls and little boys
  - May all your days be merry
  - Your seasons full of cheer

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Death_Of_Emmett_Till
  - '''Twas down in Mississippi not so long ago'
  - When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
  - This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
  - The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till
  - Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
  - They said they had a reason, but I disremember what
  - They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to repeat
  - There was screaming sounds inside the barn
  - There was laughing sounds out on the street
  - Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a blood-red rain
  - And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
  - The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
  - He was a black-skinned boy, so he was born to die
  - And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial
  - Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
  - But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
  - And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind
  - I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see
  - The smiling brothers walkin' down the courthouse stairs
  - For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
  - While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow Southern sea
  - If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
  - Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
  - Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains
  - And your blood it must refuse to flow
  - For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low
  - This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man
  - That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
  - But if all us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
  - We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

  - Born is the King of Israel
  - They looked up and saw a star
  - Shining in the East beyond them far
  - And to the Earth it gave great light
  - And so it continued both day and night
  - Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
  - Born is the King of Israel
  - Kissed by the light of that same star

  - Felt around for the light switch
  - Felt around for her face
  - Been treated like a farm animal
  - On a wild goose chase
  - West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

  - Curtain risin' on a new age
  - See the groom still waitin' at the altar
  - Try to be pure at heart
  - They arrest you for robbery
  - Mistake your shyness for aloofness
  - Your shyness for snobbery
  - Got the message this morning
  - The one that was sent to me
  - About the madness of becomin'
  - What one was never meant to be
  - West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
  - I see the turning of the page
  - Curtain risin' on a new age
  - See the groom still waitin' at the altar
  - Don't know what I can say about Claudette
  - Wouldn't come back to haunt me
  - Finally had to give her up
  - '''Bout the time she began to want me'
  - But I know God has mercy
  - On them who are slandered and humiliated
  - I'd a-done anything for that woman
  - If she'd only make me feel obligated

  - Put your hand on my head, baby
  - Do I have a temperature?
  - I see people who are supposed to know better
  - Standin' around like furniture
  - There's a wall between you
  - What you want and you got to leap it
  - Tonight you got the power to take it
  - Tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it
  - West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
  - I see the turning of the page
  - Curtain risin' on a new age
  - See the groom still waiting at the altar
  - Cities on fire
  - Phones out of order
  - They're killing nuns and soldiers
  - There's fighting on the border
  - What can I say about Claudette?
  - Ain't seen her since January
  - She could be respectably married
  - Or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires
  - West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar
  - I see the turnin' of the page

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:The_Lonesome_Death_Of_Hattie_Carroll
  - William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
  - With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
  - At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
  - And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
  - As they rode him in custody down to the station
  - And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
  - Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears
  - William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years owns a tobacco farm of six hundred
    acres
  - With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
  - And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
  - Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
  - And swear words and sneering, and his tongue, it was a-snarling
  - And in a manner of minutes, on bail was out walking
  - But you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears
  - Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
  - She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
  - Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
  - And never sat once at the head of the table
  - And didn't even talk to the people at the table
  - Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
  - And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
  - Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
  - Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
  - And she never did nothing to William Zanzinger
  - And you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears
  - In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
  - To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
  - And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
  - And that even the nobles get properly handled
  - Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
  - And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
  - Stared at the person who killed for no reason
  - Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
  - And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
  - And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance, William Zanzinger with a
    six-months entence
  - Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
  - Bury the rag deep in your face, now's the time for your tears

  - The love that faded left me only tears
  - Days that were happy turned into lonely years
  - Vows that we made turned into lies
  - My life is empty, my lonely heart cries
  - I tried to forget that we'll never be
  - Nothing left for me but just a memory
  - My way is lonely, without you I'm lost
  - My love was wasted, I'm paying the cost
  - Brown eyes, blue eyes, they're all the same
  - None are for me, I've lost this game
  - Tomorrow has nothing but worries and cares
  - The love that faded left me only tears
  - Just like the rose, your love faded away
  - Now my lonely heart must break and pay
  - Nothing now but heartaches through years
  - The love that faded left me only tears

  - And as for compensation, there's a-little he would ask
  - Take a woman like you

  - Storm clouds are raging all around my door
  - I think to myself I might not take it any more
  - Take a woman like your kind
  - To find the man in me
  - But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
  - Just to know that you are near
  - It sets my a heart a-reeling
  - From my toes up to my ears
  - The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen
  - But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine

  - The night we called it a day
  - I heard the song of the spheres
  - Like a minor lament in my ears
  - I hadn't the heart left to pray
  - The night we called it a day
  - Soft through the dark
  - The hoot of an owl in the sky
  - Sad though his song
  - No bluer than he was I
  - The moon went down stars were gone
  - But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
  - There wasn't a thing left to say
  - The night we called it a day
  - Soft through the dark
  - The hoot of an owl in the sky
  - Sad though his song
  - No bluer than he was I

  - Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam
  - And admit that the waters around you have grown
  - And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
  - If your time to you is worth savin'
  - Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
  - For the times they are a-changin'
  - Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
  - And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
  - And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
  - And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
  - For the loser now will be later to win
  - For the times they are a-changin'
  - Come senators, congressmen, please, heed the call
  - Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
  - For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
  - The battle outside ragin'
  - Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
  - For the times they are a-changin'
  - Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
  - And don't criticize what you can't understand
  - Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
  - Your old road is rapidly agin'
  - Please, get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
  - For the times they are a-changin'
  - The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
  - The slow one now will later be fast
  - As the present now will later be past
  - The order is rapidly fadin'
  - And the first one now will later be last
  - For the times they are a-changin'

  - My confidence is dwindling

  - I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line.
  - I'll have the usual
  - I'll have the usual
  - Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor
  - Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
  - Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous
  - When will that bitch serve us?
  - I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
  - Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
  - She was good, I was unkind
  - I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line

  - Or something
  - You can hang around waiting for the also rans
  - I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
  - A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away
  - I drink some more and it's judgment day
  - I had a future, but she just passed out

  - There was a wicked messenger, from Eli he did come
  - With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
  - When questioned who had sent for him, he answered with his thumb
  - For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter
  - He stayed behind the assembly hall, it was there he made his bed
  - Oftentimes he could be seen returning
  - Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand which read
  - '"The soles of my feet, I swear they''re burning"'
  - Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
  - And the people that confronted him were many
  - And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart
  - '"If you cannot bring good news, then don''t bring any"'

  - You came, you saw, you conquered me
  - When you did that to me

  - A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
  - Oh, how the ghost of you clings

  - These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman,
  - These hands are calloused and old.
  - But these hands raised a family;
  - These hands built a home.
  - Now these hands raise to pray the Lord.
  - These hands won the heart of my loved one,
  - And with hers they were never alone.
  - If these hands filled their task,
  - Then what more can one ask?
  - For these fingers have worked to the bone.
  - Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like to be,
  - For my life ain't been much success.
  - While some people have power, but still they grieve
  - While these hands brought me happiness.
  - Now I'm tired and I'm old and I ain't got much gold
  - Maybe things ain't been all that I planned.
  - But Lord above, hear my plea, when it's time to take me
  - Take a look at these hard-workin' hands.

  - And made the bells of freedom ring today
  - With a dream of beauty that they could not take away
  - Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
  - My God, they killed him.
  - The only Son of God Almighty
  - The holy one called Jesus Christ
  - He healed the sick and fed the hungry
  - And for his love they took his life away

  - You've been sleepin' in the rain
  - From the dirt of words and mud of cell
  - Your clothes are smeared and stained.
  - But the dirty words and muddy cells
  - Will soon be judged insane
  - So only stop and rest yourself
  - Till you are off again.
  - So take off your thirsty boots
  - And stay for a while
  - Your feet are hot and weary
  - From a dusty mile
  - And maybe I can make you laugh
  - And maybe I can try
  - I'm just lookin' for the evening
  - And the morning in your eyes.
  - But tell me of the ones you saw
  - As far as you could see
  - Across the plain from field to town
  - Marching to be free
  - And of the rusted prison gates
  - That tumbled by degree
  - Like laughing children one by one
  - Who looked like you and me
  - Take off your thirsty boots
  - And stay for a while
  - Your feet are hot and weary
  - From a dusty mile
  - And maybe I can make you laugh
  - And maybe I can try
  - I'm just lookin' for the evening
  - And the morning in your eyes.
  - I know you are no stranger down
  - The crooked rainbow trails
  - From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills
  - Of slender shackled jails
  - But the voices drift up from below
  - As the walls are being scaled
  - All of this and more my friend
  - Your song shall not be failed.
  - Then take off your thirsty boots
  - And stay for a while
  - Your feet are hot and weary
  - From a dusty mile
  - And maybe I can make you laugh
  - And maybe I can try
  - I'm just lookin' for the evening
  - And the morning in your eyes.

  - The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash
  - Then a lady in a bright orange dress
  - One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels
  - The Tenth Avenue bus goin' west
  - The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
  - A man with a badge skips by
  - Three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work
  - Nobody stops to ask why
  - The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
  - Where the angels stand high on their poles
  - The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
  - In this concrete world full of souls
  - The angels play on their horns all day
  - The whole earth in progression seems to pass by
  - But does anyone hear the music they play
  - Does anyone even try?

  - Thunder on the mountain and there's fires on the moon
  - A ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
  - Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
  - Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go
  - I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
  - When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
  - I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
  - I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee
  - Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
  - Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
  - You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
  - The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
  - Thunder on the mountain, rollin' like a drum
  - Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
  - I don't need any guide, I already know the way
  - Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day
  - The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
  - I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town
  - The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
  - Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
  - I've been sittin' down studyin' the art of love
  - I think it will fit me like a glove
  - I want some real good woman to do just what I say
  - Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today
  - Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
  - Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
  - Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
  - I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
  - Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
  - I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
  - I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows
  - I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
  - I got the porkchops, she got the pie
  - She ain't no angel and neither am I
  - Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
  - I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams
  - Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
  - Mean old twister bearing down on me
  - All the ladies in Washington were scrambling to get out of town
  - Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down
  - Everybody going and I want to go too
  - Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
  - I did all I could, I did it right there and then
  - I've already confessed, no need to confess again
  - Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
  - I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
  - The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
  - For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

  - Well, I had to move fast
  - And I couldn't with you around my neck.
  - I said I'd send for you and I did
  - What did you expect?
  - My hands are sweating
  - And we haven't even started yet.
  - I'll go along with the charade
  - Until I can think my way out.
  - I know it was all a big joke
  - Whatever it was about.
  - Someday maybe
  - I'll remember to forget.
  - I'm gonna get my coat,
  - I feel the breath of a storm.
  - There's something I've got to do tonight,
  - You go inside and stay warm.
  - Has anybody seen my love,
  - Has anybody seen my love,
  - Has anybody seen my love.
  - I don't know,
  - Has anybody seen my love?
  - You want to talk to me,
  - Go ahead and talk.
  - Whatever you got to say to me
  - Won't come as any shock.
  - I must be guilty of something,
  - You just whisper it into my ear.
  - Madame Butterfly
  - She lulled me to sleep,
  - In a town without pity
  - Where the water runs deep.
  - She said, "Be easy, baby,
  - There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here."
  - You're the one I've been looking for,
  - You're the one that's got the key.
  - But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
  - Or you're too good for me.
  - Has anybody seen my love,
  - Has anybody seen my love,
  - Has anybody seen my love.
  - I don't know,
  - Has anybody seen my love?
  - Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
  - And there's no moon.
  - There's just a hot-blooded singer
  - Singing "Memphis in June,"
  - While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
  - Who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
  - Later he'll be shot
  - For resisting arrest,
  - I can still hear his voice crying
  - In the wilderness.
  - What looks large from a distance,
  - Close up ain't never that big.
  - Never could learn to drink that blood
  - And call it wine,
  - Never could learn to hold you, love,
  - And call you mine.

  - Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
  - We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
  - Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
  - Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream
  - Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin'
  - We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin'
  - Starin' out the window to the stars high above
  - Time passes slow when you're searchin' for love
  - Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
  - Ain't no reason to go to the fair
  - Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
  - Ain't no reason to go anywhere

  - Stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
  - Like a red rose of summer that blooms in the day

  - It was late last night when the boss came home
  - To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
  - 'Servant said: "Boss, the lady''s gone.'
  - She left this morning just 'fore dawn."
  - '"You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man.'
  - Come to the point as straight as you can."
  - '"Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan'
  - Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand."
  - The boss he lay back flat on his bed
  - He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
  - He pondered the future of his fate
  - To wait another day would be far too late
  - '"Go fetch me my coat and my tie'
  - And the cheapest labor that money can buy.
  - Saddle me up my buckskin mare.
  - If you see me go by, put up a prayer."
  - Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
  - Eastward, long down the broad highway
  - His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
  - His men deserted him and onward he went
  - He came to a place where the light was dull
  - His forehead pounding in his skull
  - Heavy heart was racked with pain
  - Insomnia raging in his brain
  - Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
  - He renounced his faith, he denied his Lord
  - Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
  - One way or another put an end to it all
  - He leaned down, cut the electric wire
  - Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
  - Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
  - It was hard to tell for certain who was who
  - He lowered himself down on a golden chain
  - His nerves were quaking in every vein
  - His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
  - He ran his fingers through his greasy hair
  - They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
  - One single unit, inseparably linked
  - '"Got a strange premonition. There''s a man close by" (Henry Lee)'
  - '"Don''t worry about him, he wouldn''t harm a fly." (The Wife)'
  - From behind the curtain, the Boss he crossed the floor
  - He moved his feet and he bolted the door
  - Shadows hiding the lines in his face
  - With all the nobility of an ancient race
  - She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
  - With a hatred that could hit the skies
  - '"You''re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes.'
  - To come this way was by no means wise."
  - '"Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench'
  - And cover your face or suffer the consequence.
  - You are making my heart feel sick.
  - Put your clothes back on, double-quick."
  - '"Silly boy, you think me a saint.'
  - I'll listen no more to your words of complaint.
  - You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies.
  - Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes."
  - '"I''d have given you the stars and the planets, too.'
  - But what good would these things do you?
  - Bow the heart if not the knee
  - Or never again this world you'll see"
  - '"Oh, please let not your heart be cold.'
  - This man is dearer to me than gold."
  - '"Oh, my dear, you must be blind.'
  - He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind."
  - '"You''ve had your way too long with me.'
  - Now it's me who'll determine how things shall be."
  - '"Try to escape," he cussed and cursed.'
  - '"You''ll have to try to get past me first."'
  - '"Do not let your passion rule.'
  - You think my heart the heart of a fool.
  - And you, sir, you can not deny
  - You made a monkey of me, what and for why?"
  - '"I''ll have no more of this insulting chat.'
  - The devil can have you, I'll see to that.
  - Look sharp or step aside
  - Or in the cradle you'll wish you'd died."
  - The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
  - First bullet grazed his ear
  - Second ball went right straight in
  - And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin
  - He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
  - He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
  - It would take more than needle and thread
  - Bleeding from the mouth, he's as good as dead
  - '"You shot my husband down, you fiend."'
  - '"Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?'
  - He was a man of strife, a man of sin.
  - I cut him down and threw him to the wind."
  - This she said with angry breath
  - '"You too shall meet the Lord of Death.'
  - It was I who brought your soul to life."
  - Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife
  - His face was hard and caked with sweat
  - His arms ached and his hands were wet
  - '"You''re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.'
  - If you don't mind, I'll have the knife."
  - '"We''re two of a kind and our blood runs hot'
  - But we're no way similar in body or thought.
  - All husbands are good men, as all wives know."
  - Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow
  - His knees went limp and he reached for the door
  - His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
  - 'He whispered in her ear: "This is all your fault.'
  - My fighting days have come to a halt."
  - She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
  - He tried to speak but his breath was weak
  - '"You died for me, now I''ll die for you."'
  - She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through
  - All three lovers together in a heap
  - Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
  - Funeral torches blazed away
  - Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

  - Now won't you tell me true
  - Ain't that the way it ought to be?
  - To hold each other tight
  - The whole night through
  - Everything is always right
  - When I'm alone with you
  - To be alone with you
  - At the close of the day
  - With only you in view
  - While evening slips away
  - It only goes to show
  - That while life's pleasure's with you
  - The only one I know
  - Is when I'm alone with you
  - They say the night time is the right time
  - To be with the one you love
  - Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
  - But you're always what I'm thinking of
  - I wish the night was here
  - Bringing me all of your charms
  - When only you are near
  - To hold me in your arms
  - I'll always thank the Lord
  - When my working day is through
  - I get my sweet reward
  - To be alone with you

  - Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes
  - The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
  - For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes
  - And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that
    in lines
  - Your cracked country lips, I still wish to kiss, as to be by the strength of your
    skin
  - Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in
  - But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that
    just don't exist
  - It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feelin'
    like this
  - I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the
    mouth
  - I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to to the south
  - You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand
  - Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself
    feeling bad
  - I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better
    than you
  - If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
  - From fixtures and forces and friends, your sorrow does stem
  - That hype you and type you, making you feel that you gotta be just like them
  - I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring
  - For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring
  - Everything passes, everything changes, just do what you think you should do
  - And someday, maybe, who knows, baby, I'll come and be crying to you

  - The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course
  - The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
  - The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
  - But the town has no need to be nervous
  - The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
  - To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits
  - A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
  - At the head of the Chamber of Commerce
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
  - The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
  - Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made"
  - Then sends for the doctor who pulls down the shade
  - And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"
  - Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
  - He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
  - '"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride'
  - You will not die, it's not poison"
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
  - Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
  - Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
  - Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
  - Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
  - The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
  - Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
  - And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
  - Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
  - The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save
  - Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
  - Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
  - Then sends them out to the jungle
  - Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
  - With his faithful slave Pedro, behind him he tramps
  - With a fantastic collection of stamps
  - To win friends and influence his uncle
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues
  - The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
  - Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
  - At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone
  - But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
  - I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
  - I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
  - Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
  - He could die happily ever after
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues
  - Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped a bed roll
  - Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
  - And the National Bank, at a profit, sells road maps for the soul
  - To the old folks home and the college
  - I wish I could write you a melody so plain
  - That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
  - That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
  - Of your useless and pointless knowledge
  - Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
  - Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
  - I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

  - Sweet Goddess
  - Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last
  - Silver Angel
  - With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve
  - I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive
  - Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
  - I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch
  - Sweet Goddess
  - It must be time to carve another notch
  - I'm crestfallen
  - The world of illusion is at my door
  - I ain't a-haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
  - The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight
  - I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite
  - Dark Beauty
  - Meet me at the border late tonight

  - Down where the trade winds play
  - Down where you lose the day
  - We found a new world where paradise starts
  - We traded hearts way down where the trade winds play
  - Music was everywhere, flowers were in her hair
  - Under an awning of silvery boughs
  - We traded vows the night that I sailed away
  - Oh trade winds, what are vows that lovers make
  - Oh trade winds, are they only made to break
  - When it is May again
  - I'll sail away again
  - Though I'm returning, it won't be the same
  - She traded her name way down where the trade winds play

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Train_A-Travelin%27
  - There's an iron train a-travelin' that's been a-rollin' through the years
  - With a firebox of hatred and a furnace full of fears
  - If you ever heard its sound or seen its blood-red broken frame
  - Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name
  - Did you ever stop to wonder 'bout the hatred that it holds?
  - Did you ever see its passengers, its crazy mixed-up souls?
  - Did you ever start a-thinkin' that you gotta stop that train?
  - Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name
  - Do you ever get tired of the preachin' sounds of fear
  - When they're hammered at your head and pounded in your ear?
  - Have you ever asked about it and not been answered plain?
  - Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name
  - I'm a-wonderin' if the leaders of the nations understand
  - This murder-minded world that they're leavin' in my hands
  - Have you ever laid awake at night and wondered 'bout the same?
  - Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name
  - Have you ever had it on your lips or said it in your head
  - That the person standin' next to you just might be misled?
  - Does the raving of the maniacs make your insides go insane?
  - Then you've heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name
  - Do the kill-crazy bandits and the haters get you down?
  - Does the preachin' and the politics spin your head around?
  - Does the burning of the buses give your heart a pain?
  - Then you heard my voice a-singin' and you know my name

  - Train of love's a comin', big black wheels are hummin'
  - People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'
  - Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby
  - Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
  - But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
  - Now stop your whistle blowin' 'cause I've got ways of knowin'
  - You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'
  - Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'
  - Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
  - But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
  - Train of love now hasten, sweethearts stand and waitin'
  - Here and there and everywhere there'll gonna be embracin'
  - Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby
  - Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
  - But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
  - Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'
  - But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'
  - We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever
  - Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
  - But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

  - Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm
  - You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm
  - But they can't help you none when there's trouble
  - Trouble
  - Trouble, trouble, trouble
  - Nothin' but trouble
  - Trouble in the water, trouble in the air
  - Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there
  - Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble
  - Trouble
  - Trouble, trouble, trouble
  - Nothin' but trouble
  - Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul
  - Persecution, execution, governments out of control
  - You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble
  - Trouble
  - Trouble, trouble, trouble
  - Nothin' but trouble
  - Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground
  - You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
  - Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble
  - Trouble
  - Trouble, trouble, trouble
  - Nothin' but trouble
  - Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned
  - Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed
  - Look into infinity, all you see is trouble
  - Trouble

  - I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins,
  - Death can be the result of the most underrated pain.
  - Satan whispers to ya, "Well, I don't want to bore ya,
  - But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya."
  - Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
  - Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
  - When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero,
  - It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero.
  - You think you can hide but you're never alone,
  - Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone.
  - Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
  - Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
  - Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air,
  - He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your hair.
  - He's gonna deaden your conscience 'til you worship the work of your own hands,
  - You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land.
  - Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
  - Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
  - Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong,
  - You say, "Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong."
  - The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie,
  - Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify.
  - Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
  - Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
  - So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss,
  - They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross.
  - They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives,
  - Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives.
  - Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind,
  - Lord, take away this trouble in mind.
  - When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke,
  - How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?
  - Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed,
  - Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed.

  - I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes
  - When she's near me she's so hard to recognize
  - But I finally realize there's no room for regret
  - True love, true love, true love tends to forget
  - Hold me, baby be near
  - You told me that you'd be sincere
  - But every day of the year like playin' Russian roulette
  - True love, true love, true love tends to forget
  - I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
  - I saw you in the wilderness among the men
  - I saw you drift into infinity and come back again
  - All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when
  - You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell
  - You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
  - And this weekend in hell is making me sweat
  - True love, true love, true love tends to forget
  - True love, true love, true love tends to forget
  - I was lyin' down in the reeds without any oxygen
  - I saw you in the wilderness among the men
  - Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
  - All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when
  - You belong to me, baby, without a doubt
  - Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out
  - Don't keep me knockin' about from Mexico to Tibet

  - Trust yourself,
  - Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
  - Don't trust me to show you beauty
  - When beauty may only turn to rust.
  - If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
  - Trust yourself,
  - Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
  - Trust yourself,
  - Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
  - Don't trust me to show you the truth
  - When the truth may only be ashes and dust.
  - If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
  - Well, you're on your own, you always were,
  - In a land of wolves and thieves.
  - Don't put your hope in ungodly man
  - Or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
  - Trust yourself
  - And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
  - Trust yourself
  - And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
  - Don't trust me to show you love
  - When my love may be only lust.
  - If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

  - The air is getting hotter
  - There's a rumbling in the skies
  - I've been wading through the high muddy water
  - With the heat rising in my eyes
  - Every day your memory grows dimmer
  - It doesn't haunt me like it did before
  - I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
  - Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
  - When I was in Missouri
  - They would not let me be
  - I had to leave there in a hurry
  - I only saw what they let me see
  - You broke a heart that loved you
  - Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
  - I've been walking that lonesome valley
  - Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
  - People on the platforms
  - Waiting for the trains
  - I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
  - Like pendulums swinging on chains
  - When you think that you've lost everything
  - You find out you can always lose a little more
  - I'm just going down the road feeling bad
  - Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
  - I'm going down the river
  - Down to New Orleans
  - They tell me everything is gonna be all right
  - 'But I don''t know what '
  - ' even means'
  - I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
  - Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
  - I been all around the world, boys
  - Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
  - Gotta sleep down in the parlor
  - And relive my dreams
  - I'll close my eyes and I wonder
  - If everything is as hollow as it seems
  - Some trains don't pull no gamblers
  - No midnight ramblers, like they did before
  - I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
  - Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

  - Two big bags of dead man's bones
  - Got their noses to the grindstones
  - Living in the Land of Nod
  - Trustin' their fate to the hands of God
  - They pass by so silently
  - Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
  - Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire
  - They're taking a streetcar named Desire
  - Looking in the window at the pecan pie
  - Lot of things they'd like they would never buy
  - Neither one gonna turn and run
  - They're making a voyage to the sun
  - Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
  - Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
  - All that and more and then some
  - They walk among the stately trees

  - They're like babies sittin' on a woman's knee
  - Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
  - Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
  - I got love for you and it's all in vain
  - Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil
  - They're dripping with garlic and olive oil
  - Tweedle-dee Dee, he's on his hands and his knees
  - 'Saying, '
  - Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
  - Well, they're living in a happy harmony
  - Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
  - They're one day older and a dollar short
  - They've got a parade permit and a police escort
  - They're lying low and they're makin' hay
  - They seem determined to go all the way
  - They run a brick and tile company
  - Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
  - Well a childish dream is a deathless need
  - And a noble truth is a sacred creed
  - My pretty baby, she's lookin' around
  - She's wearin' a multi-thousand dollar gown
  - Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man

  - His voice was low with pain
  - '"I''ll do your bidding, comrade mine'
  - If I ride back again
  - But if you ride back and I am left
  - You'll do as much for me
  - Mother, you know, must hear the news
  - So write to her tenderly
  - '"She''s waiting at home like a patient saint'
  - Her fond face pale with woe
  - Her heart will be broken when I am gone
  - I'll see her soon, I know."
  - Just then the order came to charge
  - For an instance hand touched hand
  - They said, "Aye," and away they rode
  - That brave and devoted band
  - Straight was the track to the top of the hill
  - The rebels they shot and shelled
  - Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
  - And guarded them as they fell
  - There soon came a horrible dying yell
  - From heights that they could not gain
  - And those whom doom and death had spared
  - Rode slowly back again
  - But among the dead that were left on the hill
  - Was the boy with the curly hair
  - The tall dark man who rode by his side
  - Lay dead beside him there
  - There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
  - The words that her lover had said
  - Momma, you know, awaits the news
  - And she'll only know he's dead

  - Ya must be livin' in the shadow of some kind of evil star.

  - They said it was the land of milk and honey,
  - Now they say it's the land of money.
  - Who ever thought they could ever make that stick.
  - It's unbelievable you can get this quick.
  - Every head is so dignified, every moon is so sanctified,
  - Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
  - All the silver, all the gold, all the sweethearts you can hold
  - That don't come back with stories untold, are hanging on a tree.
  - It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
  - It's so impossible to even learn the tune.
  - Kill that beast and feed that swine,
  - Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
  - Feed that horse and saddle up the drum.
  - It's unbelievable, the day would finally come.
  - Once there was a man who had no eyes,
  - Every lady in the land told him lies,
  - He stood beneath the silver skies
  - And his heart began to bleed.
  - Every brain is civilized,
  - Every nerve is analyzed,
  - Everything is criticized when you are in need.
  - It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
  - So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
  - Turn your back, wash your hands,
  - There's always someone who understands
  - It don't matter no more what you got to say

  - Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
  - We'll sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
  - And Louise holds a handful of rain
  - Tempting you to defy it
  - Lights flicker from the opposite loft
  - In this room the heat pipes just cough
  - The country music station plays soft
  - But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
  - Just Louise
  - And her lover, so entwined
  - And these visions of Johanna
  - That conquer my mind
  - In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain
  - And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D Train
  - We can hear the nightwatchman click his flashlight
  - Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
  - Louise, she's alright, she's just near
  - She's delicate and seems like the mirror
  - But she makes it all to concise and clear
  - That Johanna's not here
  - The ghost of electricity
  - Howls in the bones of her face
  - Where these visions of Johanna
  - Have now taken my place
  - Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
  - He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
  - And when bringing her name up
  - He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
  - He's sure got a lot of gall
  - To be so useless and all
  - Muttering small talk at the wall
  - While I'm in the hall
  - Oh, how can I explain?
  - It's so hard to get on
  - And these visions of Johanna
  - They've kept me up past the dawn
  - Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
  - Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
  - But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
  - You can tell by the way she smiles
  - See the primitive wallflower freeze
  - When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
  - Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeez,
  - I can't find my knees"
  - Both jewels and binoculars
  - Hang from the head of the mule
  - But these visions of Johanna
  - They make it all seem so cruel
  - The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
  - Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer
    for him"
  - But like Louise always says
  - '"You can''t look at much, can you man?" as she herself prepares for him'
  - My Madonna, she still has not showed
  - We see this empty cage now corrode
  - Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
  - The fiddler, he now steps to the road
  - He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
  - On the back of the fish truck that loads
  - While my conscience explodes

  - I never dreamed it could be
  - A someone made just for me.
  - When I'm letting her have her way,
  - I'm here to see what she has to say.
  - Aw, the poor girl always wins the day.
  - I'm stayin' ahead of the game,
  - And she's a-doin' the same,
  - And the whiskey flyin' into my head.
  - The fiddler's arm has gone dead,
  - And talk is beginning to spread
  - When did our love go bad?
  - Whatever happened to the best friend that I had?
  - It's been so long since I held you tight
  - Been so long since we said goodnight.
  - The taste of tears is bittersweet.
  - When you're near me, my heart forgets to beat.
  - You're there every night
  - Among the good and the true,
  - And I'll be around, waitin' for you.
  - Well, the king of them all
  - Is starting to fall.
  - I lost my gal at the boatman's ball.
  - The night has a thousand hearts and eyes.
  - Hope may vanish, but it never dies.
  - I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings.
  - I'm gonna stay on top of things.
  - It's the middle of summer,
  - And the moon is blue.
  - And I'll be around, waitin' for you.
  - Another deal gone down,
  - Another man done gone.
  - You put up with it all, and you carry on.
  - Something holding you back,
  - But you'll come through.
  - I'd bet the world and everything in it on you.
  - Happiness is but a state of mind.
  - Anytime you want, you can cross the state line.
  - You don't need to be rich
  - Or well-to-do,
  - I'll be around, waitin' for you.

  - Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
  - I'm walkin' down the line
  - An' I'm walkin' down the line.
  - My feet'll be a-flyin'
  - To tell about my troubled mind.
  - I got a heavy-headed gal
  - I got a heavy-headed gal
  - I got a heavy-headed gal
  - She ain't feelin' well

  - My money comes and goes
  - My money comes and goes
  - My money comes and goes
  - And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
  - Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes
  - Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
  - I'm walkin' down the line
  - An' I'm walkin' down the line.
  - My feet'll be a-flyin'
  - To tell about my troubled mind.
  - I see the morning light
  - I see the morning light
  - Well it's not because
  - I'm an early riser
  - I didn't go to sleep last night
  - Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
  - I'm walkin' down the line
  - An' I'm walkin' down the line.
  - My feet'll be a-flyin'
  - To tell about my troubled mind.
  - I got my walkin' shoes
  - I got my walkin' shoes
  - I got my walkin' shoes
  - An' I ain't a-gonna lose
  - I believe I got the walkin' blues
  - Well, I'm walkin' down the line,
  - I'm walkin' down the line
  - An' I'm walkin' down the line.
  - My feet'll be a-flyin'

  - Oh, the age of the inmates
  - 'I remember quite freely:'
  - No younger than twelve,
  - No older 'n seventeen.
  - Thrown in like bandits
  - And cast off like criminals,
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - From the dirty old mess hall
  - You march to the brick wall,
  - Too weary to talk
  - And too tired to sing.
  - Oh, it's all afternoon
  - You remember your home town,
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - Oh, the gates are cast iron
  - And the walls are barbed wire.
  - Stay far from the fence
  - With the 'lectricity sting.
  - And it's keep down your head
  - And stay in your number,
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - Oh, it's fare thee well
  - To the deep hollow dungeon,
  - Farewell to the boardwalk
  - That takes you to the screen.
  - And farewell to the minutes
  - They threaten you with it,
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - It's many a guard
  - That stands around smilin',
  - Holdin' his club
  - Like he was a king.
  - Hopin' to get you
  - Behind a wood pilin',
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - The night aimed shadows
  - Through the crossbar windows,
  - And the wind punched hard
  - To make the wall-siding sing.
  - It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleepin',
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - As the rain rattled heavy
  - On the bunk-house shingles,
  - And the sounds in the night,
  - They made my ears ring.
  - '''Til the keys of the guards'
  - Clicked the tune of the morning,
  - Inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.
  - Oh, some of us'll end up
  - In St. Cloud Prison,
  - And some of us'll wind up
  - To be lawyers and things,
  - And some of us'll stand up
  - To meet you on your crossroads,
  - From inside the walls,
  - The walls of Red Wing.

  - Love that's pure hopes all things
  - Believes all things, won't pull no strings
  - Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
  - Capture your soul and hold it for ransom
  - You don't want a love that's pure
  - You wanna drown love
  - You want a watered-down love
  - Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims
  - Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
  - Will not deceive you or lead you to transgression
  - Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession
  - You don't want a love that's pure
  - You wanna drown love
  - You want a watered-down love
  - Love that's pure won't lead you astray
  - Won't hold you back, won't get in your way
  - Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
  - It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious
  - You don't want a love that's pure
  - You wanna drown love
  - You want a watered-down love
  - Love that's pure, no accident
  - It knows what it knows, is always content
  - An eternal flame, quietly burning
  - Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning
  - You don't want a love that's pure
  - You wanna drown love
  - You want a watered-down love

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:We_Better_Talk_This_Over
  - I think we better talk this over
  - Maybe when we both get sober
  - You'll understand I'm only a man
  - Doin' the best that I can
  - This situation can only get rougher
  - Why should we needlessly suffer?
  - Let's call it a day, go our own different ways
  - Before we decay
  - You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face
  - We've done nothing to each other time will not erase
  - I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
  - You been two-faced, you been double-dealing
  - I took a chance, got caught in the trance
  - Of a downhill dance
  - Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
  - I'm exiled, you can't convert me
  - I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
  - With both eyes glazed
  - You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone
  - Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home
  - I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
  - If I have to beg, steal or borrow
  - It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
  - Look at each other and laugh
  - But I don't think it's liable to happen
  - Like the sound of one hand clappin'
  - The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
  - '''Neath the bed where we slept'
  - Don't think of me and fantasize on what we never had
  - Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad
  - Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
  - Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope
  - Oh, babe, time for a new transition
  - I wish I was a magician
  - I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
  - That we've both gone beyond

  - I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
  - I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
  - Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
  - Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
  - 'Ever since you walked right in, the circle''s been complete, '
  - 'I''ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street, '
  - 'To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun, '
  - 'I love you more than ever and I haven''t yet begun. '
  - 'You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live, '
  - 'When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give, '
  - 'Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole, '
  - 'Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul. '
  - You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
  - 'Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife, '
  - 'My thoughts of you don''t ever rest; they''d kill me if I lie, '
  - 'I''d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die. '
  - 'The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth, '
  - 'We''ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth, '
  - 'What''s lost is lost; we can''t regain what went down in the flood, '
  - 'But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood. '
  - 'It''s never been my duty to remake the world at large, '
  - 'Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge, '
  - '''Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn''t bend, '
  - 'And if there is eternity I''d love you there again. '
  - 'Oh, can''t you see that you were born to stand by my side. '
  - 'And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride, '
  - 'You''re the other half of what I am; you''re the missing piece. '
  - 'And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn''t cease. '
  - 'You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see, '
  - 'Just bein'' next to you is a natural thing for me. '
  - 'And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on, '
  - '''Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.'

  - Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
  - Filled up a hunger that had always been denied

  - And You've chosen me to be among the few
  - What can I do for You?
  - You have laid down Your life for me
  - What can I do for You?
  - You have explained every mystery
  - What can I do for You?
  - Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
  - He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie
  - Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
  - Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do
  - What can I do for You?
  - You have given all there is to give
  - What can I do for You?

  - And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
  - And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try

  - What good am I then to others and me
  - If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see

  - For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
  - It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
  - Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
  - For like a thief in the night, He'll replace wrong with right
  - When He returns.
  - Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
  - He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
  - How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
  - How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
  - Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
  - Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
  - Until He returns?
  - Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,
  - He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
  - How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
  - How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
  - Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,
  - He's got plans of His own to set up His throne
  - When He returns.

  - Dodging lions and wastin' time
  - Oh those mighty kings of the jungle

  - It sure has been a long hard climb.
  - Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
  - When I ran on a hilltop following a pack of wild geese
  - Someday everything is gonna sound like rhapsody
  - When I paint my masterpiece.
  - Sailing around the world in a dirty gondola
  - Sure wish I hadn't sold my old Victrola
  - Ain't nothing like to that good old rock-n-rolla
  - I left Rome and pulled into Brussels
  - On a plain ride so bumpy that I almost cried
  - Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles
  - Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
  - Newspapermen eating candy
  - Had to be held down by big police
  - Someday everything is gonna be different
  - When I paint that masterpiece.

  - In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
  - Where wisdom grows up in strife
  - My bewildered brain toils in vain
  - Through the darkness on the pathways of life
  - Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
  - Tomorrow keeps turning around
  - We live and we die, we know not why
  - But I'll be with you when the deal goes down
  - We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
  - Far down the street we stray
  - I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
  - Things I never meant nor wished to say
  - The midnight rain follows the train
  - We all wear the same thorny crown
  - Soul to soul, our shadows roll
  - And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
  - Well, the moon gives light and it shines by night
  - When I scarcely feel the glow
  - We learn to live and then we forgive
  - O'er the road we're bound to go
  - More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
  - That keep us so tightly bound
  - You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
  - And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
  - Well, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
  - I followed the winding stream
  - I heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joys
  - I know they're not what they seem
  - In this earthly domain full of disappointment and pain
  - You'll never see me frown
  - I owe my heart to you and that's sayin' it true
  - And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

  - Look out across the fields, see me returning
  - Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
  - From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
  - You've had time to think about it for a while
  - Well, I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over
  - It's the end of the chase and the moon is high
  - It won't matter who loves who
  - You'll love me or I'll love you
  - When the night comes falling from the sky
  - I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting
  - Sorrow covers you up like a cape
  - Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
  - With disaster that you managed to escape
  - I can't provide for you no easy answers
  - Who are you that I should have to lie?
  - You'll know all about it, love
  - It'll fit you like a glove
  - When the night comes falling from the sky
  - I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
  - You must have been protecting someone last time I called
  - I've never asked you for nothing you couldn't deliver
  - I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall
  - I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
  - For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die
  - Stick around, baby, we're not through
  - Don't look for me, I'll see you
  - When the night comes falling from the sky
  - In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
  - It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
  - I don't want to be a fool starving for affection
  - I don't want to drown in someone else's wine
  - For all eternity I think I will remember
  - That icy wind that's howling in your eye
  - You will seek me and you'll find me In the wasteland of your mind
  - When the night comes falling from the sky
  - Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
  - But you were gambling for support
  - This time tomorrow I'll know you better
  - When my memory is not so short
  - This time I'm asking for freedom
  - Freedom from a world which you deny
  - And you'll give it to me now
  - I'll take it anyhow
  - When the night comes falling from the sky

  - Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
  - And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
  - Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins
  - The hour that the ship comes in
  - And the sea will split and the ships will hit
  - And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
  - And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
  - And the morning will be a-breaking
  - The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
  - And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
  - And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
  - The hour that the ship comes in
  - And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
  - Will not be understood as they're spoken
  - For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
  - And be buried at the bottom of the ocean
  - A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
  - And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
  - And the sun will respect every face on the deck
  - The hour that the ship comes in
  - And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
  - For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
  - And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
  - That the whole wide world is watchin'
  - Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
  - And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming
  - But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real
  - The hour that the ship comes in
  - And they'll raise their hands, saying "We'll meet all your demands"
  - But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered"
  - And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide
  - And like Goliath they'll be conquered

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:When_The_World_Was_Young
  - It isn't by chance I happen to be
  - A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
  - For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
  - I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
  - I walk in a room, a party or ball
  - '"Come sit over here", somebody will call'
  - '"A drink for M''sieur, a drink for us all!"'
  - But how many times I stop and recall
  - Ah, the apple trees
  - Blossoms in the breeze
  - That we walked among
  - Lying in the hay
  - Games we used to play
  - While the rounds were sung
  - Only yesterday when the world was young
  - Wherever I go they mention my name
  - And that in itself, is some sort of fame
  - '"Come by for a drink, we''re having a game"'
  - Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
  - The talk is quite gay, the company fine
  - There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
  - And beautiful girls and some of them mine
  - But often my eyes see a different shine
  - Ah, the apple trees
  - Sunlit memories
  - Where the hammock swung
  - On our backs we'd lie
  - Looking at the sky
  - Till the stars were strung
  - Only last July when the world was young

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Dylan:Where_Are_You_Tonight%3F
  - There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain
  - Tears on the letter I write
  - There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missin' her so much
  - But she's drifting like a satellite
  - There's a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
  - And laughter down on Elizabeth Street
  - There's a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
  - Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat
  - Her father would emphasize you got to be more than street-wise
  - But he practiced what he preached from the heart
  - A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
  - The time and the place that we'd part
  - There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
  - And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
  - And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
  - Of a book that nobody can write
  - Oh, where are you tonight?
  - The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
  - To live it you had to explode
  - In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
  - Sacrifice was the code of the road
  - I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
  - Strong men belittled by doubt
  - I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were
  - But she had some way of finding them out
  - He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same
  - She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
  - She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
  - And discovered her invisible self
  - There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped
  - There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
  - As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
  - Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might
  - Oh, if I could just find you tonight
  - I fought with my twin, that enemy within
  - Till both of us fell by the way
  - Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
  - While the law looks the other way
  - Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
  - The man you were lovin' could never get clean
  - It felt out of place, my foot in his face
  - But he shoulda stayed where his money was green
  - I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
  - With the juice running down my leg
  - Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss
  - Who always was too proud to beg
  - There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
  - And a pathway that leads up to the stars
  - If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise
  - Just remind me to show you the scars
  - There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived
  - If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived
  - I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive
  - But without you it doesn't seem right
  - Oh, where are you tonight?

  - Where is the one who'll end the search I'm making
  - Where is the one who'll change my dream to waking
  - Behind some far off secret door there's my love
  - There's my life in store
  - The journey's long, much longer than I reckoned
  - In any throng I'll know her in a second
  - Some lucky day I'm bound to find her
  - And when I do I'll find love
  - The journey's long, much longer than I reckoned
  - In any throng I'll know her in a second
  - Some lucky day I'm bound to find her
  - And when I do I'll find love

  - Far away where the soft winds blow,
  - Far away from it all,
  - There is a place you go
  - Where teardrops fall.
  - Far away in the stormy night,
  - Far away and over the wall,
  - You are there in the flickering light
  - Where teardrops fall.
  - We banged the drum slowly
  - And played the fife lowly
  - You know the song in my heart
  - 'Bridge: In the turning of twilight'
  - In the shadows of moonlight
  - You can show me a new place to start
  - I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
  - Strippin' away at it all,
  - Thinking of you when the sun comes up
  - Where teardrops fall.
  - By rivers of blindness,
  - In love and with kindness
  - We could hold up a toast if we meet
  - 'Bridge: To the cuttin'' of fences'
  - To sharpen the senses
  - That linger in the fireball heat.
  - Roses are red, violets are blue
  - And time is beginning to crawl,
  - I just might have to come see you
  - Where teardrops fall.

  - Oh, my name, it ain't nothin', my age, it means less
  - The country I come from is called the Midwest
  - I's taught and brought up there, the laws to abide
  - And that the land that I live in has God on its side
  - Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well
  - The cavalries charged, the Indians fell
  - The cavalries charged, the Indians died
  - Oh, the country was young with God on its side
  - The Spanish-American War had its day
  - And the Civil War too was soon laid away
  - And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
  - With guns in their hands and God on their side
  - The First World War, boys, it came and it went
  - The reason for fighting I never did get
  - But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
  - For you don't count the dead when God's on your side
  - The Second World War came to an end
  - We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
  - Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried
  - The Germans now too have God on their side
  - I learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life
  - If another war comes, it's them we must fight
  - To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide
  - And accept it all bravely with God on my side
  - But now we got weapons of chemical dust
  - If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
  - One push of the button and a shot the world wide
  - You never ask questions when God's on your side
  - Through many a dark hour I been thinkin' about this
  - That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
  - But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
  - Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side
  - So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell
  - The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell
  - The words fill my head and they fall to the floor
  - That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war

  - There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town
  - Starlight by the edge of the creek
  - The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
  - Money's gettin' shallow and weak
  - Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory
  - It's a new path that we trod
  - They say low wages are a reality
  - If we want to compete abroad
  - My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
  - Come sit down on my knee
  - You are dearer to me than myself
  - As you yourself can see
  - While I'm listening to the steel rails hum
  - Got both eyes tight shut
  - Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
  - Creeping it's way into my gut
  - Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
  - Bring me my boots and shoes
  - You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
  - Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
  - Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
  - Tossed by the winds and the seas
  - I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
  - I'll sell 'em to their enemies
  - I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
  - Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
  - Sometimes no one wants what we got
  - Sometimes you can't give it away
  - Now the place is ringed with countless foes
  - Some of them may be deaf and dumb
  - No man, no woman knows
  - The hour that sorrow will come
  - In the dark I hear the night birds call
  - I can feel a lover's breath
  - I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
  - Sleep is like a temporary death
  - Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
  - Bring me my boots and shoes
  - You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
  - Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
  - Well, they burned my barn and they stole my horse
  - I can't save a dime
  - I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
  - Into a life of continual crime
  - I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
  - How I wish you were here to see
  - Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
  - That you have forgotten me?
  - Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
  - They waste your nights and days
  - Them I will forget
  - But you I'll remember always
  - Old memories of you to me have clung
  - You've wounded me with your words
  - Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
  - It's all true, everything you've heard
  - Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
  - Bring me my boots and shoes
  - You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
  - Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
  - In you, my friend, I find no blame
  - Wanna look in my eyes, please do
  - No one can ever claim
  - That I took up arms against you
  - All across the peaceful sacred fields
  - They will lay you low
  - They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
  - I say it so it must be so
  - Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
  - Gonna give you another chance
  - I'm all alone, I'm expecting you
  - To lead me off in a cheerful dance
  - I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
  - I can live on rice and beans
  - Some people never worked a day in their life
  - 'Don''t know what work even means '
  - Well, meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
  - Bring me my boots and shoes
  - You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline
  - Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

  - I'll be back home in a month or two
  - When the frost is on the vine
  - I'm gonna punch my spear right straight through
  - Half-ways down his spine
  - Then I'll lift my arms to the star-lit skies
  - And I'll pray the fugitive prayer
  - I'm guessin' tomorrow the sun will rise
  - I hope the final end's been spared
  - Now the battle is over, up in the hills
  - And the mist is settlin' in
  - Look at me with all my spoils
  - What did I ever win?

  - Stranded out in the night,
  - Eliza took me down
  - To see the widow give
  - Rain to the town.
  - It's against the law
  - To be a tonic man
  - But the widow knows
  - She's got the upper hand.
  - So I went on in
  - Feelin' kinda wheezy.
  - You know she soothed my mind, boys,
  - She rocked me kinda slow and easy
  - All day and all night.
  - Pick a card before you go
  - It's a long trip to Mexico.
  - Eliza wait by the door,
  - I can't stay here anymore, no, no.
  - Then she took a pill
  - She washed her feet in the mud
  - She said "look out son, you know,
  - I just ordered a flood
  - For forty days and forty nights".
  - Then I dropped my shoes,
  - Eliza called my name.
  - She said it looked to her
  - Like it's gonna rain.
  - Then the cotton king
  - Came in chokin'
  - And the widow laughed and said,
  - '"I ain''t jokin''."'
  - '"Take once for all"'
  - She said, "Now don't ya tease me.
  - I just fell in love, boy,
  - So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy,
  - All day and all night."
  - Sweet william said
  - With a drunken head,
  - '"If I had a boat,'
  - I'd help y'all float".
  - Eliza stood there watching,
  - William in a trance,
  - As the widow did
  - The St. vitus dance.
  - But just then an old man
  - With a boat named "Breezy"
  - Said, "You can ride with Clyde, boys,
  - If you rock it kinda slow and easy,
  - All day and all night".

  - And I'm back in the rain
  - Oh, and you are on dry land
  - You made it there somehow
  - You're a big girl now
  - Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
  - He's singing his song for me at his own expense
  - And I'm just like that bird
  - Oh, singing just for you
  - I hope that you can hear
  - Hear me singing through these tears
  - Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
  - Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last
  - I can change I swear
  - Oh, see what you can do
  - I can make it through
  - You can make it too
  - Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
  - You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
  - Oh I know where I can find you
  - Oh, in somebody's room
  - It's a price I have to pay
  - You're a big girl all the way
  - A change in the weather is known to be extreme
  - But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream
  - I'm going out of my mind
  - Oh, with a pain that stops and starts
  - Like a corkscrew to my heart

  - I've seen love go by my door
  - It's never been this close before
  - Never been so easy or so slow
  - I been shootin' in the dark too long
  - When something's not right it's wrong
  - You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
  - Dragon clouds so high above
  - I've only known careless love
  - It always has hit me from below
  - But this time 'round it's more correct
  - Right on target so direct
  - You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
  - Purple clover, Queen Anne lace
  - Crimson hair across your face
  - You can make me cry but you don't know
  - Can't remember what I was thinking of
  - You might be spoiling me too much love
  - You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
  - Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
  - Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
  - Blue river running slow and lazy
  - I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
  - Situations have ended sad
  - Relationships have all been bad
  - Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's
  - But there's no way I can compare
  - All them scenes to this affair
  - You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
  - You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
  - Staying far behind without you
  - You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
  - You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to
  - I'll look for you in old Honolulu
  - San Francisco or Ashtabula
  - You're gonna have to leave me now I know
  - But I'll see you in the sky above
  - In the tall grass in the ones I love

  - If you're young at heart
  - You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
  - You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
  - And life gets more exciting with each passing day
  - And love is either in your heart, or on it's way
  - Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
  - To be young at heart
  - For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
  - To be young at heart
  - And if you should survive to 105
  - Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
  - And here is the best part, you have a head start
  - If you are among the very young at heart
  - And if you should survive to 105

  - Love and only love, it can't be denied
  - No matter what you think about it
  - You just won't be able to do without it
  - Take a tip from one who's tried

  - On whiskey and beer,
  - I go to some hollow,
  - And sit at my still
  - And if whiskey don't kill me,
  - Then I don't know what will,
  - I go to some bar room,
  - And drink with my friends,
  - Where the women can't follow,
  - And see what I spend,
  - God bless them pretty women,
  - I wish they was mine,
  - Their breath is as sweet,
  - The dew on the vine,
  - Let me eat when I am hungry,
  - Let me drink when I am dry,
  - A dollar when I am hard up,
  - Religion when I die,
  - The whole world's a bottle,
  - And life's but a dram,
  - When the bottle gets empty,
  - It sure ain't worth a damn.

  - I am a poor wayfaring stranger
  - Traveling through this world of woe
  - There's no sickness, no toil or danger
  - In that bright land to which I go
  - I'm going there to see my father
  - I'm going there no more to roam
  - I'm going there just over Jordan
  - I'm going there to my new home
  - One of these mornings, and it won't be long
  - All men will rise and stand side by side
  - Then hand in hand they're bound for glory
  - Their foes will fall before freedom's tide
  - I'm goin' there to see my brother
  - I'm goin' there no more to roam
  - I'm goin' there just over Jordan
  - I'm goin' there to my new home
  - I'm goin' there to see my mother
  - I'm goin' there no more to roam
  - I'm goin' there just over Jordan
  - I'm goin' there to my new home
  - I am a poor wayfaring stranger

  - Take off your lies, they don't match with your eyes
  - You said you were conscious of fashion
  - You don't really want what you ask for in front
  - Status has no place in passion
  - You think you've lost if you give straight across
  - Without making deals for attention
  - Somebody taught you that love must be bought
  - From your pride with the coins of convention
  - Don't make bargains for the things I will give you anyhow
  - We won't have the time tomorrow to buy a ticket back to now
  - You only lose when you let yourself confuse
  - What you want with what you think you should try for
  - I'll give what I can but I'll keep what I am
  - Let's take what we don't have to vie for

  - Do you ever think about me Eleanor
  - When the dawn is on the misty sky
  - Like white sheets over London streets
  - As the morning greets your angel eyes
  - Turning to watch you wave Eleanor
  - I knew there was nothing to save any more
  - But when you walk through your memories
  - I'd like to think that you look for me
  - I wish I could be sure Eleanor
  - I have thought about you Eleanor
  - When we drank that sweet red wine
  - Peeking low at the songs that flow
  - From a radio that only worked sometimes
  - One thing I just couldn't stand to ignore
  - Is that you knew what to do with your hands Eleanor
  - I'm just hoping that now and then
  - Your thoughts go back to those nights again
  - That's all I'm asking for Eleanor
  - Do you ever think about me Eleanor
  - Rolling out on a silver jet
  - The good, good times that we left behind
  - Stay on my mind, I won't forget
  - And if you ever dream of me
  - I just hope that you're glad that we
  - Opened up those special doors Eleanor

  - Baby ask your man if he
  - Would let you come along with me
  - And watch the morning hit the sea
  - Or would he like that
  - If you think he'll take it wrong
  - Just tell him I won't keep you long
  - As soon as our good times are gone
  - I'll bring you right back
  - But until then could anything be finer
  - Than rolling toward the ocean in your trusty Morris Minor
  - Go ask your man
  - I'm sure he'll understand
  - While you're on the subject
  - Would you ask politely if you could
  - Just bring an open mind to put
  - Some good times into
  - Would you ask permission to
  - Be free just long enough for you
  - To love me for a day or two
  - At least begin to
  - Tell him you'll try not to get your clothes too sandy
  - Just let him know that I'm from a decent family
  - Go ask your man
  - I'm sure he'll understand
  - Let him know it's not my style
  - To keep you more than just a while
  - I'm hung up the way you smile
  - And love your laughter
  - Tell him I repect his taste
  - And I don't want to take his place
  - A chance to fill the empty space
  - Is all I'm after
  - Give him your word that you won't be gone forever
  - Let's you and I watch the sun come up together
  - Go ask your man
  - I'm sure he'll understand
  - Babe if he should ask of you
  - Just tell him I won't do to you
  - A single thing he wouldn't do
  - Except not own you
  - Also could you take the time
  - To ask your man to please define
  - The words he screams across the line
  - Each time I phone you
  - And if he still takes a negative position
  - Tell him that I'll bring you back in good condition
  - Go ask your man
  - I'm sure he'll understand

  - Star bright gypsy night spring is on your breezes
  - Young wild Friday's child going where he pleases
  - Coquettish blooming lilacs float their perfume throught the window
  - Teasing me and tempting me to leave my restless limbo
  - Some may call it wanderlust, some may call it crazy
  - I don't call it anything, I just let it take me
  - Dark blue slips into closing skies of twilight
  - Till streets take my feet dancing toward the midnight
  - It's just the kind of night that brings a special kind of hunger
  - Searching for the kind of love you had when you were younger
  - Some may call it wanderlust, some may call it crazy
  - I don't call it anything, I just let it take me
  - Soft wind rolling in settles down upon me
  - I'm bound toward the sound of something just beyond me
  - Through the sleeping city with confetti starlight falling
  - Open eyed and moving toward the distant voice that's calling
  - Some may call it wanderlust, some may call it crazy
  - I don't call it anything, I just let it take me

  - Look down the ragged road behind us
  - The strangers that we used to be are lost along the way
  - Let's look for something to remind us
  - Of lovers painting dreams across the skies of yesterday
  - How could we come so far
  - From what we really are
  - Oh, babe, take my hand, lead me back where the road began
  - Oh, babe, take me home, bring me back to myself again
  - Some nights I lie awake and wonder
  - Longing to embrace the girl who used to have your name
  - Warm lips that tasted like the summer
  - Have melted and dissolved into the vacuum that remains
  - We're on a brand new ground
  - Every direction's down
  - Oh, babe, take my hand, lead me back where the road began
  - Oh, babe, take me home, bring me back to myself again
  - Where are the valleys we expected
  - When promises on silver wings were leading into time
  - So few mistakes can be corrected
  - Looking back at all your brave beginnings going blind
  - What has become of me
  - My eyes refuse to see
  - Oh, babe, take my hand, lead me back where the road began
  - Oh, babe, take me home, bring me back to myself again
  - We can't put it back together
  - But how can I return to what I was before we met
  - Lost in the mountains we've come over
  - The setting sun is giving up a dying silhouette
  - Something along the line
  - Has rearranged my mind
  - Oh, babe, take my hand, lead me back where the road began
  - Oh, babe, take me home, bring me back to myself again

  - Angel that you are you still remember summer walks
  - And quiet talks we had before our clouds were breaking
  - In the heaven of your mind your hopeful heart has put behind
  - All the ugly jealous times our hearts were aching
  - Now that your pain has been mended
  - You're only seeing one side
  - Behind the bright easy laughter
  - Rivers of tears have been cried
  - So remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
  - You've got to try and see that's it's gone for you and me
  - And there is no way to bring it back again
  - In a sad unstable way I love you more than I can say
  - But now it's locked in yesterday and must remain there
  - The gentle prisoner in the stall sometimes forgets the very walls
  - That gave her shelter in the fall have also chained her
  - Drink from the spring of tomorrow
  - Yesterday's well has gone dry
  - All the good times are behind us
  - And whenever you ask yourself why
  - Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
  - On the ocean of a smile we floated easy for awhile
  - But now we've drifted to the shore where beauty dies
  - It isn't easy to explain I never dreamed you felt the same
  - But even though you're not to blame we can't continue
  - Don't let yourself pretend that we've got something to defend
  - You've got to try to face the end with all that's in you
  - I can't deny that I love you
  - But my soul can no longer be bound
  - Fly on the wings of your freedom
  - But whenever you look to the ground
  - Just remember the rain when you think of the sunshine
  - Try to understand it has fallen from our hands
  - And just be thankful that your soul is still your own

  - City sidewalks guide her feet
  - Up the hill to Stanyan Street
  - Ran out of money yesterday
  - She doesn't have a place to stay
  - Suitcase carries everything she owns
  - She can't afford to take a Greyhound home
  - But don't expect to see her cry
  - She's a San Francisco woman
  - She knows how to get by
  - When she's down to seeds and stems
  - And pawned off everything she can
  - She's got no problems, she's got friends
  - Glad to pull her up again
  - And when she's over on the other end
  - She'll get the chance to do the same for them
  - So don't feel sorry for the girl
  - She's a San Francisco woman
  - She can live in her world
  - Good times keep within her reach
  - Midnight walks along the beach
  - And when she's home and friends come up
  - They drink wine out of paper cups
  - She loves the people and the life she lives
  - She won't apologize for what she is
  - So don't expect her to
  - She's a San Francisco woman
  - She knows how to make do
  - She's a down home woman she's not a queen
  - And when her grass is not so green
  - She can live on rice and beans
  - And wash her clothes without machines
  - And when she's down without a dime
  - She'll recover every time
  - She'll never shiver in the rain
  - She's a San Francisco woman
  - She knows how to maintain

  - When first I came to Reno
  - I was kicked at cussed at ego busted
  - Shaggy dusty maladjusted
  - Looking for an open door to get in off the street
  - I wound up being pushed into
  - A businessman's convention luncheon
  - Torn and tattered briefcase battered
  - Got out just before they branded beatnik on my feet
  - It's a B-movie world and the cast is on vacation on location every day
  - In Reno Funtown U.S.A.
  - Escaping down an alley I was
  - Sickened chicken panic stricken
  - Turned and seen a sports arena
  - Ran into a snarling mob of roller derby fans
  - Reception there was less than warm
  - With knuckles teeth and hairy arms
  - I fell into the first motel
  - And closed the door and hid myself below the TV stand
  - It's a B-movie world and the cast is on vacation on location every day
  - In Reno Funtown U.S.A.
  - The maid came by for room inspection
  - Throwing trays in my direction
  - Sanitized for my protection
  - I jumped out the window, ran into a grocery store
  - I didn't have a shopping list
  - They thought I was a communist
  - Who fluoridated frozen fish
  - They put me in a chafing dish and rolled me out the door
  - It's a B-movie world and the cast is on vacation on location every day
  - In Reno Funtown U.S.A.
  - I made it just in time to get
  - A ticket on a super jet
  - As everyone was making bets
  - On just how long the plane would fly before it took a dive
  - Reno has a law forbidding
  - Bums to look at married women
  - Tuxes must be worn to swim in
  - If you're there with shaggy hair you may not leave alive
  - It's a B-movie world and the cast is on vacation on location every day
  - In Reno Funtown U.S.A.
  - In Reno Funtown U.S.A.

  - Yes I've seen her often through the rain
  - Her voice is soft and frightened like a child in the night
  - Her mind is a kaleidoscope of spinning black and white
  - Her eyes can only focus on weakness
  - In the summer sounds around her she hears bleakness
  - Her laughter is a door that never opens
  - 'Yes I''ve seen her '
  - But we've never spoken
  - All the times we've faced each other miles between our souls
  - I've wondered how she's learned to live her life and not have goals
  - It seemed that she was always in the shadows
  - The stranger who neither leads nor follows
  - Too high above it all to let her heart be broken
  - 'Yes I''ve seen her '
  - But we've never spoken
  - Haunted by her values, disenchanted with herself
  - She's used to human ugliness and looks for nothing else
  - She lies inside your arms within the closeness of a kiss
  - Holding back the secret of what she really is
  - Hiding from you as her eyes are closing
  - 'Yes I''ve seen her '
  - But we've never spoken

  - The times are gone that brought the girl
  - Who watched me try to change the world
  - When I believed I'd write the songs
  - To point to roads of right and wrong
  - Silently she watched me try to put the world on trial
  - West Virginia summer's child
  - The night before I had to leave
  - When Denver winter stripped the trees
  - I cried all night against a nightgown sleeve
  - I only hope that she believes
  - I know what I was leaving
  - When I refuse to turn my eyes
  - From all my shabby alibis
  - And think I'm more than what I am
  - I hope she knows I'm glad I can
  - Surrender to the memory of the understanding smile
  - Of West Virginia summer's child

  - But from 'neath the little blanket peeked no precious infant face
  - How I longed to _______ but angels form one more sweet kiss obtained
  - From the rosy lips that had pressed against the windowpane
  - Oh my heart seemed almost breaking as I gathered from the floor
  - Here a shoe and there a stocking that our little darling wore
  - And I could not though I loved the room one moment more remain
  - Where those snowy hands had left their print upon the windowpane
  - How the silent tear drops were falling

  - Maddened men ran everywhere
  - In that big Ohio prison tragedy
  - Ways to safety were all blocked
  - Many cells were barred and locked
  - And the raging flames brought death and agony
  - Frantic convicts begged for air
  - Many were cremated there
  - Oh, the horror of that scene! The moans and pleas
  - While the red inferno raged
  - Human beings, trapped and caged
  - How they prayed and cried to God on bended knees
  - Picture an old lady there
  - Climbing up the smold'ring stair
  - Looking for her boy, a victim of the flames
  - Now her tears are falling fast
  - And she finds her son at last
  - All a-tremble she looks on his charred remains
  - 'Man: Is this your son''s body, lady?'
  - 'Woman: Oh, this might be him. Oh, he''s little and frail like that. Oh, Jimmy,
    Jimmy, it''s Mother, Honey, Mother.Oh, Mother knows you were good.-You were always
    good to Mother, weren''t you dear?'

    finished with him. The state''s finished with all of these bodies, these poor

    Oh, bodies, bodies, bodies! I can''t stand it! I can''t stand it! I can''t stand
    it!'
  - Now the state so graciously
  - Gives his body back to her
  - After life has flown and he has paid the toll
  - Prison bars kept them apart
  - Kept him from her lonely heart
  - But they can't imprison his immortal soul
  - Oh, society may sneer
  - At these convicts lying here
  - After all, they're human, be they what they may
  - Judge not each man for his crime
  - For we'll all be judged sometime

  - There's one that gets and always got while the other poor one ain't
  - Oh, the rich man drives his Lincoln past the red light with a grin
  - And the poor man follows right behind in his little hunk of tin
  - There's a motorcycle copper following upon their trail
  - Oh, the rich man tears his ticket, but the poor man goes to jail
  - Oh, the rich man takes the high road anywhere that he may go
  - But when the poor man's travelin' he must always take the low
  - So if you're rich you'll travel snug as peas are in the pod
  - Oh, the rich man rides a cushion and the poor man rides the rods
  - Oh, the rich man when he's ailing stays at home and calls the doc
  - But the poor man has to go to work, be in time to punch a clock
  - The rich man takes his medicine, has his doctors and his nurse
  - So the rich man he gets better but the poor man he gets worse!
  - Oh, the rich man steals a million from the bank that he controls
  - While the poor man steals a loaf of bread or a penny's worth of rolls
  - They take them to the courthouse, one is laughing, one's in tears
  - Oh, the rich man gets an apology while the poor man gets ten years!
  - Oh, the rich man gets a lawyer and the lawyer pleads his case
  - While the poor man asks for sympathy but of that there is now trace
  - So if you're rich don't worry but the poor must give up hope
  - Oh, the rich man gets acquitted while the poor man gets the rope!
  - Oh, the rich man when he kicks off has a casket made of gold
  - While the poor man has a wooden box and his grave looks mighty cold
  - The rich man gets a sermon but here's one thing that's sure
  - When the rich man takes that last long ride he's as much dead as the poor!

  - I've counted the days, love
  - I've counted the nights
  - I've counted the footsteps
  - I've counted the lights
  - I've counted the raindrops
  - I've counted the stars
  - I've counted a million
  - Of these prison bars
  - I've waited, I've trusted
  - I've longed for the day
  - A lifetime, so lonely
  - Now my hair's turning grey
  - My thoughts are for you, love
  - Till I'm out of my mind
  - For twenty-one years
  - Is a mighty long time
  - I've counted on you, babe, to give me a break
  - I guess you forgot, love, I'm here for your sake
  - You know who's guilty, you know it so well
  - But I'll rot in prison, before I will tell
  - Come all you young fellows with hearts brave and true
  - Don't believe any woman you'd meet if you do
  - Don't trust any woman, no matter what kind
  - For twenty-one years, boys, is a mighty long time

  - They say everybody's got a job to do, well it looks like I just got fired
  - I was making my way back home to you, thought I had the whole thing wired
  - Suddenly I hear a voice in my hear saying "wait a minute, not so fast"
  - A man makes plans that knocks him flat and God sits back and laughs
  - If I don't make it home for Christmas, it don't mean I don't care
  - If I can't get leave by by new year's eve make believe that I'm not there
  - If I don't fly by by the 4th of July, it don't signify that I can't sigh
  - Only that I'm trying to clear my mind and it's tough through all of these tears
  - You may not want that blind folk, when they lead you to the wall
  - You may need to read the writing there before you take the fall
  - You might regret the last cigarette when it all goes up in smoke
  - And the voice in your hear says "hey in there, you finally get the joke"
  - If I don't make it home for Christmas, it don't mean I don't care
  - If I can't get leave by by new year's eve make believe that I'm not there
  - If I don't fly by by the 4th of July, it don't signify that I can't sigh
  - Only that I'm trying to clear my mind and it's tough through all of these tears
  - Woke up underneath the tree last year feeling just a little bit flat
  - Seems everybody's got a special gift, mine has come unwrapped
  - And I heard that voice in my ear again, this time it seemed to say
  - '"Anything that you really want to keep, first you got a learn to give it away"'
  - If I don't make it home for Christmas, it don't mean I don't care
  - If I can't get leave by by new year's eve make believe that I'm not there
  - If I don't fly by by the 4th of July, it don't signify that I can't sigh
  - Only that I'm trying to clear my mind and it's tough through all of these tears

  - Havana midnight - velvet wind
  - "Soft as sin against the skin - along the Malec\xF3n"
  - Her eyes reflect the light of the candle
  - Her hair as sweet as any mango
  - In her arms we whisper of tomorrow
  - And wonder how the story ends
  - Havana midnight - velvet wind
  - From El Morro we can see the harbor
  - And hear the sound of jazz across the water
  - Music charms the heart of any sailor
  - Man enough to sail these seven seas
  - Havana midnight - velvet wind
  - "Soft as sin against the skin - along the Malec\xF3n"
  - "In the park old men take the time for b\xE9isbol"
  - In la Calle old ladies hear of troubles
  - In the dark children see things in the shadows
  - Lovers have the hours until the dawn
  - Havana midnight - velvet wind

  - 'It was Christmas in Las Vegas, when the locals take the town '
  - Theresa hit a streak and laid her waitress' apron down
  - 'She''d been playin'' penny poker over at the ol'' Gold Spike '
  - She won at Texas Hold'em, and again at Let It Ride
  - Over on Fremont Street, six bits won her a car
  - So she rode it up the Strip where the flashy hotels are
  - First she hit a royal -- not a dirty one this time
  - Then she drew four deuces -- and then five wilds
  - Hundred dollar "Homerun" -- three coin "Red, White and Blue"
  - '"Double Jackpots" -- "Double Diamonds" -- (both progressives, too)'
  - Five buck "Black and Gold", five times in a row
  - '"Blazing Sevens" seven times, so the story goes'
  - She even hit "Big Bertha" -- five grand for just one coin
  - She placed it on a parlay -- took the Cowboys and the points
  - She had the 'Niners and the "over" -- the "under" and the Jets
  - She took the whole college schedule and she won every bet
  - She picked the six in Powerball -- she called the Super Bowl
  - She even had the Triple Crown - win, place, and show
  - At baccarat and blackjack, she could not seem to lose
  - At French roulette she pressed her bet, four times on 32
  - She held the dice forever -- at least it seemed that way
  - She won a million dollars and then she walked away
  - It was Christmas in Las Vegas, when the locals take the town
  - Theresa hit a streak and laid her waitress' apron down
  - In her room after New Years at the Thunderbird Hotel
  - On the back of a winning keno card they found this living will
  - My friends get all my money -- may they always have enough
  - To my enemies I leave my luck -- only maybe not quite so tough
  - The dealers get my "bones" -- may they keep 'em on a roll
  - The Devil's had my body, now may the Good Lord take my soul
  - So do not try to find me, for I will not be found
  - I'm gonna keep this stake alive -- I'm headed out of town
  - It was Christmas time in Vegas, when the locals take the town
  - Theresa hit that streak, and laid her waitress' apron down.

  - Plugged 16 Shells from a thirty-ought-six
  - And the black crow flew through
  - A hole in the sky
  - And I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule
  - And I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba
  - And I leaned it up against a dandelion tree
  - Leaned it up against a dandelion tree
  - Leaned it up against a dandelion tree
  - Well I cooked them feathers on the tire iron spit
  - And I filled me a sachel full of old pig corn
  - And I beat me a Billy from an old French horn
  - And kicked that mule to the top of the tree
  - Kicked that mule to the top of the tree
  - Blew me a hole 'bout the size of a kick-drum
  - And I cut me a switch from a long branch elbow
  - I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
  - Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
  - Whittle you into kindlin'
  - Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
  - Well I slept in the hotter of a dry creek bed
  - And I tore out the buckets from a red corvette
  - Tore out the buckets from a red corvette
  - Lionel, Dave and the butcher made three
  - You got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinny bone tree
  - With the strings of a Washburn
  - Stretched like a clothesline
  - You know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
  - Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
  - I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
  - Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
  - Whittle you into kindlin'
  - Black crow 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
  - Now I hold him prisoner in a Washburn jail
  - And I strapped it on the back of my old kick mule
  - Strapped it on the back of my old kick mule
  - Bang on the strings just to drive him crazy
  - And I strum it loud just to rattle his cage
  - Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
  - Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
  - Strum it loud just to rattle his cage
  - I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'

  - She went
  - And we settled near the blue lagoon
  - Listened all night to the wind

  - Sometimes we just went for a swim

  - When she went, yeah when she went
  - Yeah, now we sit here in the evening

  - Seems like yesterday
  - But it was long ago
  - Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
  - There in darkness with the radio playin' low
  - And the secrets that we shared
  - Mountains that we moved
  - Caught like a wildfire out of control
  - Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
  - And I remember what she said to me
  - How she swore that it never would end
  - I remember how she held me oh so tight
  - Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
  - Against the wind
  - We were running against the wind
  - We were young and strong
  - We were running against the wind
  - The years rolled slowly past
  - And I found myself alone
  - Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
  - Found myself further and further from my home and I
  - Guess I lost my way
  - There were oh so many roads
  - I was livin' to run and running to live
  - Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe
  - Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
  - Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
  - I began to find myself searchin'
  - Searchin' for shelter again and again
  - Against the wind
  - Little somethin' against the wind
  - I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind
  - Well, those drifters days are past me now
  - I've got so much more to think about
  - Deadlines and commitments
  - What to leave in, what to leave out
  - Against the wind
  - I'm still running against the wind
  - I'm older now but still running against the wind
  - Well, I'm older now and still running
  - Against the wind
  - Against the wind

  - Lord knows how bad we wanted to play
  - But we got homesick for Lincoln Park, imagine
  - And man we just couldn't stay
  - Tricky Dick, he played it slick
  - Something I was afraid he'd do, back in '72
  - Then all our new born philosophers
  - Our windows for the world
  - Pessimistic pseudo-intellectual
  - Avant-garde-ish pearls
  - Takin' notes on the holocost
  - They're copying it down on their sleeve
  - It was so hip to be negative
  - So square to try and believe
  - When the waters cleared, it was what we feared
  - We learned nothin' new,
  - Back in '72

  - He wants to dream like a young man
  - With the wisdom of an old man
  - He wants his home and security
  - He wants to live like a sailor at sea
  - Beautiful loser
  - Where you gonna fall?
  - When you realize
  - You just can't have it all
  - He's your oldest and your best friend
  - If you need him, he'll be there again
  - He's always willing to be second-best
  - A perfect lodger, a perfect guest
  - Beautiful loser
  - Read it on the wall
  - And realize
  - You just can't have it all
  - You just can't have it all
  - You just can't have it all
  - Oh, oh, can't have it all
  - You can try, you can try, but you can't have it all
  - Oh yeah
  - He'll never make any enemies, enemies, no
  - He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze
  - He'll always ask, he'll always say please
  - Beautiful loser
  - Never take it all
  - '''Cause it''s easier'
  - And faster when you fall
  - You just don't need it all
  - You just don't need it all

  - You're old enough to know better as soon as you can see
  - This world is out to get you the way it's gotten me
  - It starts out in the morning then moves to afternoon
  - By the time you reach the evenin' you're barkin' at the moon
  - Between what you're told and what you've seen
  - You'll know that it's just another show
  - Everybody sells somethin'everybody's got game
  - We all keep believin' no one is to blame
  - The world keeps getting hotter, ice falls in the sea
  - We buy a bigger engine and say it isn't me
  - Between what we say and what we mean
  - It's clean far away from that machine
  - We talk on the phone because we're alone
  - And everyone knows it
  - We feel overdue, we want something new
  - And everyone knows it
  - It's time to join with the living, time to understand
  - We're all in this together, we've got to have a plan
  - We're facing an extinction every other day
  - There's got to be an answer, we've got to find a way
  - Between what is dead and what is green
  - We learn what to keep and what to burn
  - Between what is fair and what's obscene
  - It's clean far way from that machine

  - Once, a good woman loved me
  - Kinda cruel, and she left me one day
  - Now I'm cryin', she loves another

  - And he'll have left you far behind
  - Ah, but you must realize he needs you

  - You'll find it easy to be kind... kind
  - The stars may shimmer in the black sky
  - The wind may rustle in the trees
  - You may be worried he may psych you
  - You might be praying on your knees
  - Ah, but when you realize he needs you
  - And when you finally take some time
  - The cool black night will fall upon you
  - You'll find it easy to unwind
  - Hey, the moon may rise on the misty mountain
  - You'll wish you never made the climb
  - But when the black night's finally with you

  - And it's tears that are falling
  - From these brown eyes now
  - And I wonder where you are
  - And I whisper your name (I whisper your name)
  - And the only way to find you
  - Is if I close my eyes
  - And find you with my blind love

  - I was out on the road tonight making real good time
  - Heading out of the frozen north for the Mason-Dixon line
  - I pulled off at sunrise and I stopped up on some bridge
  - And looked out on the Blue Ridge
  - I could hear the echoes tumbling down the gaps
  - Cannon firing, musket shots and someone playing Taps
  - 150 years ago I was a Yankee in some ditch
  - Fighting for the Blue Ridge
  - Trying to take the Blue Ridge
  - Pick me up in Virginia, carry me to Carolina
  - Set me down in Georgia right on time
  - From the Shenandoah, all the way to Tennessee
  - The fearsome Haliwa warlords, the mighty Cherokee
  - They held these ancient misty hills
  - With a willful iron fist all along the Blue Ridge
  - All along the Blue Ridge
  - Yeah!

  - Nights were warm
  - Dreams were easy
  - No one standing overhead
  - Conversation didn't mean much
  - We were hungry but could not be fed
  - Radio blasting silly little love songs
  - We only listened for the beat
  - Taking our chances
  - Out there on the mean streets
  - Hiding in the shadows from the heat
  - We weren't lovers just brave strangers
  - As we fought and we tumbled through the night
  - We were players not arrangers
  - As we jammed till the dawn's early light
  - Swimming in the big lake
  - Taking it easy
  - Taking any comfort we could find
  - Didn't need the real truth
  - Didn't need the meaning
  - Straight ahead ignoring every sign
  - Every sign
  - And oh I remember I know you do too
  - Oh that one evening
  - I know you do too, baby
  - I know you remember it too
  - The moon was high
  - Moon was flying high
  - We were hiding in the backwoods
  - Hiding out in the backwoods
  - With the moon flying high
  - My hand was shaking
  - And you took my hand
  - And it went all right
  - And it went all right
  - It went all right
  - So we walked out hardly speaking
  - Disappearing in the night
  - Saw each other a few times after
  - But we never really got it right
  - We weren't lovers just brave strangers
  - As we rolled and we tumbled through the night
  - We were players not arrangers
  - And we jammed till the dawn's early light

  - You can change the way you live
  - You can make it?
  - You can turn it up or down
  - You can change the things you're told
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
  - Oh oh oh
  - You can lie to every face
  - You can use a stranglehold
  - You can lose or win the chase
  - You can sell your very soul
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
  - Oh oh oh
  - You can steal the things you need
  - You can keep the people down
  - You can take the best there is
  - To the shelters underground
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
  - You can crucify the word on a cross of gold

  - Here I am, oh my time's rolling slowly by
  - 21 years old, waiting on my turn to die
  - Every minute Lord, every minute seems like five
  - And if it wasn't for the window,
  - I'd wonder if the world outside was alive
  - Yeah, smokin' cigarettes, drinkin' coffee
  - And waiting on my last meal, I try to pretend
  - I try to pretend but this cell is much too real
  - Oh, I should have left that chick alone
  - I curse the day, I curse the day she was born, now
  - Oh the old men they tell me
  - They tell me love is akin to hate
  - But before I die, I just gotta get it straight now
  - Crush out my cigarette, throw away my coffee and scream
  - Ah, I don't wanna die
  - Oh, I don't wanna die
  - Oh, it's too late they'll be comin' for me soon
  - It's too late to pray, and anyway, God can't see this room
  - I'm startin' to sweat now, It won't be long now
  - I can see
  - They're gonna put me in that chair
  - They're gonna put me in that chair and that's how the end's gonna be
  - Yeah, it's gettin' cold, it's gettin' colder
  - And I'm startin' to scream, Ah I don't wanna die
  - Don't leave me here to die

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Seger:Democracy
  - It's coming through a hole in the air
  - From those nights in Tiananmen Square
  - It's coming from the feel
  - That this ain't exactly real
  - Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
  - From the wars against disorder
  - From the sirens night and day
  - From the fires of the homeless
  - 'From the ashes of the gay:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
  - It's coming through a crack in the wall
  - On a visionary flood of alcohol
  - From the staggering account
  - Of the Sermon on the Mount
  - Which I don't pretend to understand at all
  - It's coming from the silence
  - On the dock of the bay
  - From the brave, the bold, the battered
  - 'Heart of Chevrolet:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
  - It's coming from the sorrow in the street
  - The holy places where the races meet
  - From the homicidal bitchin'
  - That goes down in every kitchen
  - To determine who will serve and who will eat
  - From the wells of disappointment
  - Where the women kneel to pray
  - For the grace of God in the desert here
  - 'And the desert far away:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
  - Sail on, sail on
  - O mighty Ship of State!
  - To the Shores of Need
  - Past the Reefs of Greed
  - Through the Squalls of Hate
  - Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on
  - It's coming to America first
  - The cradle of the best and of the worst
  - It's here they got the range
  - And the machinery for change
  - And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
  - It's here the family's broken
  - And it's here the lonely say
  - That the heart has got to open
  - 'In a fundamental way:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
  - It's coming from the women and the men
  - Oh baby, we'll be making love again
  - We'll be going down so deep
  - The river's going to weep
  - And the mountain's going to shout Amen!
  - It's coming like the tidal flood
  - Beneath the lunar sway
  - Imperial, mysterious
  - 'In amorous array:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.
  - Sail on, sail on...
  - I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
  - I love the country but I can't stand the scene
  - And I'm neither left or right
  - I'm just staying home tonight
  - Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
  - But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
  - That Time cannot decay
  - I'm junk but I'm still holding up
  - 'This little wild bouquet:'
  - Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

  - She got a tip from Aunt Mary, said.(?somebody?) was
  - In love with you
  - She was so nieve, famous for her childlike mind,
  - I don't believe she ever opened her bedroom venetian blinds
  - Already Eddie was unsteady on the levee

  - Little Willy was Chicago's boyfriend, a local screw
  - He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his
  - Hobnail shoes
  - Already Eddie, pitching for pennies, rockin' for bennies,
  - Wound up in the local hole, without a radio,
  - And he wrote Aunt Mary said "Momma, it's getting hairy, Down Home."
  - Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed
  - Eddie on out
  - Which tripped out Willie, oh man you should've heard
  - Him shout...
  - Yeah they wandered off somewhere, they couldn't find
  - Their way home.
  - Any road home
  - You know I'd really like to take her but you know I

  - I climb through the window and down the street
  - Shining like a new dime
  - The downtown trains are full
  - With all those Brooklyn girls
  - They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
  - You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
  - They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
  - They're just thorns without the rose
  - Be careful of them in the dark
  - Oh if I was the one
  - You chose to be your only one
  - Oh baby can't you hear me now
  - Will I see you tonight
  - On a downtown train
  - Every night its just the same
  - You leave me lonely, now
  - I know your window and I know its late
  - I know your stairs and your doorway
  - I walk down your street and past your gate
  - I stand by the light at the four way
  - You watch them as they fall
  - They stay at the carnival
  - But they'll never win you back
  - Will I see you tonight
  - On a downtown train
  - Where every night its just the same
  - You leave me lonely
  - Will I see you tonight
  - On a downtown train
  - All of my dreams just fall like rain
  - All upon a downtown train

  - Oh Johnny Johnny no
  - Johnny Johnny no
  - The night passed like a thousand years
  - The tenement room had cooled her tears

  - There's a crossroad, where all the victims meet
  - I close my eyes, and see her face
  - It's all I want to see
  - And deep inside, it still amazes me
  - Even now
  - She's all that I want
  - She's all that I need

  - She's keepin' me strong
  - She gets to me, somehow, Even now
  - And through the darkness, through all the endless days
  - Through all the changes, the pointless one act plays
  - I can still make it, I can still stand tall
  - '''Cause I''ve got my girl, to get me through it all'
  - Through all the doubt, and all the fear
  - And all that I can't say, still somehow

  - There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight
  - There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight
  - Through the concrete canyons to the midtown lights
  - Where the latest neon promises are burning bright
  - Past the open windows on the darker streets
  - Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry
  - Past the phony posers with their worn out lines
  - The tired new money dressed to the nines
  - The low life dealers with their bad designs
  - And the dilettantes with their open minds
  - You're out on the town, safe in the crowd
  - Ready to go for the ride
  - Searching the eyes, looking for clues
  - There's no way you can hide
  - The fire inside
  - Well, you've been to the clubs and the discotheques
  - Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises
  - Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks
  - Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious
  - And the lights go down and they dance real close
  - And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm
  - Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone
  - The darkness scatters as the lights flash on
  - They hold one another just a little too long
  - And they move apart and then move on
  - On to the street, on to the next
  - Safe in the knowledge that they tried
  - Faking the smile, hiding the pain
  - Never satisfied
  - The fire inside, fire inside
  - Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep
  - You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave
  - Like you knew he would
  - You hear his car pull away in the street
  - Then you move to the door and you lock it when
  - He's gone for good
  - Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon
  - Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky
  - And it comes to you how it all slips away
  - Youth and beauty are gone one day
  - No matter what you dream or feel or say
  - It ends in dust and disarray
  - Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass
  - Waves rolling in with the tide
  - Dreams die hard and we watch them erode
  - But we cannot be denied
  - The fire inside
  - Fire inside
  - Oh, fire inside
  - Burnin' you up
  - Burnin' you up
  - Fire inside

  - Forward into the past
  - From the silent frozen winter, to dark and endless night
  - Where the plains stretch out forever in a sea of barren white
  - To the billion dollar merger, to bailouts in the east
  - Where currencies are mangled and Wall Street has a feast
  - Independence is our motive, out of favor, out of sync
  - Abandoned and forgotten, discarded in the blink of an eye
  - His hometown's nearly empty now
  - Schools and churches too

  - And it hit me like a diamond bullet right between the eyes
  - And I believed everything you said

  - Calling into question everything that I believe in
  - Huddled with the masses
  - Stranded at the Gates of Eden

  - I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
  - Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'
  - Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over
  - Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further
  - All our fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
  - 'Had my girl beside me brother. '
  - Brother she was burnin' burnin'
  - Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
  - She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her
  - We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'
  - She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
  - All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
  - The cops came bustin' in and then we lit out in our pickup truck go
  - Get out of Denver better go go
  - Get out of Denver better go
  - Get out of Denver better go go
  - Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
  - And you might just be a member better
  - 'Better Get out of Denver '
  - Better Get out of Denver
  - Well red lights were flashin' and the sirens were a-screamin'
  - We had to pinch each other just to see if we was dreamin'
  - Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
  - Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower
  - The rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber
  - We kept on drivin' till we ran into some fog cover
  - We couldn't see a thing somehow we just kept on goin'
  - We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'fog.
  - It finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
  - 'We''re starin'' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat '
  - And go Get out of Denver he said go go
  - Get out of Denver better go
  - Get out of Denver better go go
  - Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
  - 'And you might just be a member '
  - 'Better get out of Denver '
  - 'Better get out of Denver better go '
  - Oh better better better go
  - Hey go
  - Ah better better go go go go
  - Cause you look just like a commie
  - And you might just be a member better
  - Get out of Denver better go!

  - You were here
  - Now you're gone
  - And we all keep moving on
  - Like the wind
  - And the sea
  - That's the way it has to be
  - When I think about you I always smile
  - Then I go back for a while
  - You were young
  - You were bold
  - And you loved your rockin' soul
  - You were strong
  - You were sharp
  - But you had the deepest heart
  - You showed the whole world what we knew
  - There was no one quite like you

  - Golden boy
  - Take your place
  - Among the stars
  - Light your fire
  - Cast your glow
  - Near and far
  - Mother's eyes
  - Warm you when you sleep
  - There's a tree
  - By a brook
  - In the glade
  - There's a wave
  - Off a cape
  - Making way
  - Galaxies
  - Rush away from you
  - I'll be there
  - In the wind
  - In your sails
  - Through the clouds
  - Through the fog
  - Through the gates
  - I'll be there
  - Golden boy for you

  - This gravestone is peaceful and quiet
  - She pulls up a chair and sits right by it
  - The air around is gentle and warm
  - The rose colored wreath is tattered and torn
  - Tiny blades of grass are peeking through
  - Drawing life from sunshine and dew
  - Remembering his eyes when she lied
  - Knowing she lives feeling she's died
  - Da da da da da da da
  - Da da da da da da da
  - Where have all the good time gone
  - Where have all the good time gone
  - Where have all the good time gone my child
  - Da da da da da da da
  - Da da da da da da da
  - So every night after sunshine
  - You'll find her there alone in her shrine
  - Two forms appearing ghostly in rain
  - One red marble the other blue pain
  - Where have all the good time gone
  - Where have all the good time gone
  - Where have all the good time gone my child

  - Let the right one in, take the wrong one out
  - In a poor old world, that's what it's about
  - Took a million years, with it thousands more
  - She walked out evolution's door
  - She's a winner, she cannot lose
  - Her body's gracile, she's the one you'd choose
  - You'll shout and holler, and lose your voice
  - Her body's gracile, you have no choice
  - Like the break of dawn, like the light of day
  - She's got it all, can't look away
  - She's a winner, all around the world
  - Her bodies gracile, your chosen girl
  - She's a winner, she owns your soul
  - Her body's gracile, and she's in control
  - Oh-oh yes
  - I said oh-oh yes
  - Don't have much sense, and I ain't too smart
  - One thing I know, she stands apart
  - When I watch her walk, when I see her dance
  - My little brain, ain't got much chance
  - She's a winner, and it's understood
  - Her body's gracile, it's more than good
  - She's a winner, she'll get away
  - Her body's gracile, and she's here to stay

  - I've seen two time losers running everywhere
  - Shouting and screamin', "I was never there!"
  - With their hands in the air
  - Hands in the air
  - I've seen bad news messengers avoiding kings
  - Cheating spouses twisting their rings
  - With their hands in the air
  - Ooh, got their hands in the air
  - As guilty as the wind out on the sea
  - Affecting who we are and who we'll be
  - There's a desperation, a real despair
  - Even the good people are starting to declare
  - I've got my hands in the air
  - Ah my hands are in the air
  - They're surrendering, they're giving in
  - They'll do anything not to go through this again
  - They've got their hands in the air
  - Ooh, their hands in the air
  - And they're sinking in the quicksand like a stone
  - Broken to the marrow of the bone, oh
  - The dealers are dividing up their tips
  - The gamblers, they're all cashin' in their chips
  - There's a man in the middle of a parking lot
  - Wondering which way he should go
  - There's a star on the horizon
  - Sinking low, low
  - All you death wish addicts, you corrupters of truth
  - You killers of the spirit, you marauders of youth
  - Get your hands in the air
  - I want to see your hands in the air
  - If you're selling these lies, these impossible dreams
  - You can keep on washin' but you'll never get clean
  - Get your hands in the air
  - Let me see your hands in the air

  - She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
  - He was a midwestern boy on his own
  - She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
  - He knew right then he was too far from home
  - He was too far from home
  - She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
  - They watched the waves tumble over the sand
  - They drove for miles and miles up those twisting turning roads
  - Higher and higher and higher they climbed
  - And those Hollywood nights
  - In those Hollywood hills
  - She was looking so right
  - In her diamonds and frills
  - All those big city nights
  - In those high rolling hills
  - Above all the lights
  - She had all of the skills
  - He'd headed west 'cause he felt that a change would do him good
  - See some old friends, good for the soul
  - She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
  - He saw that face and he lost all control
  - He had lost all control
  - Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
  - Then came that morning he woke up alone
  - He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
  - Wondering if he could ever go home
  - And those Hollywood nights
  - In those Hollywood hills
  - It was looking so right
  - It was giving him chills
  - In those big city nights
  - In those high rolling hills
  - Above all the lights
  - With a passion that kills
  - In those Hollywood nights
  - In those Hollywood hills
  - She was looking so right
  - In her diamonds and frills
  - All those big city lights
  - In those high rolling hills
  - Above all the lights

  - I knew you when the mountain tops were right beneath your feet
  - When artistry and freedom were complete
  - Before you were an icon, before they all too came
  - You could say I knew you when
  - We all sit here with our memories, of a glorious long ago
  - When our heroes seemed immortal, were they really so
  - It's a question for a wiser man

  - In your time
  - The innocence will fall away
  - In your time
  - The mission bells will toll
  - All along
  - The corridors and river beds
  - There'll be sign
  - In your time
  - Towering waves
  - Will crash across your southern capes
  - Massive storms
  - Will reach your eastern shores
  - Fields of green
  - Will tumble through your summer days
  - By design
  - In your time
  - Feel the wind
  - And set yourself the bolder course
  - Keep your heart
  - As open as a shrine
  - You'll sail the perfect line
  - And after all
  - The dead ends and the lessons learned
  - After all
  - The stars have turned to stone
  - There'll be peace
  - Across the great unbroken void
  - All benign
  - In your time
  - You'll be fine
  - In your time

  - I was walkin' to the corner drug store
  - And what should I happen to see
  - There were picket lines
  - And the people were a shoutin'
  - '"Down with democracy"'
  - As I strolled on by someone grabbed my arm and said
  - '"Buddy where do you stand"?'
  - I said "I stand wherever I choose my friend
  - And you best let go of my hand"
  - "As I walked away on a sunny day, I swear I\xC2 heard him scream"
  - '"You know you''re leanin'' on my dream"'
  - '"Hey man you''re leanin on my dream"'
  - Got home and turned on the TV set
  - And sat me down to eat
  - And a man came on
  - Talkin' 'bout the coppers
  - They were blockin' off another street
  - Seems some folks was raisin' cain
  - And a riot had broke out
  - And they flashed the camera on the guy who had stopped me
  - I watched him runnin' about
  - As the cops were draggin him away
  - I heard on of 'em scream
  - '"You know you''re leanin'' on my dream"'
  - '"These kids are leanin'' on my dream"'
  - Oh yeah
  - Well I got up and turned off the TV set
  - And to tell you I was feelin' mean
  - An I thought a while
  - Tryin' to make some sense
  - Out of everything that I have seen
  - I was addin' the score when there's a knock on the door
  - Was a letter addressed to me
  - It read "greetings from the president, united states"
  - I fell down on my knees
  - The next day I was on the picket line
  - And Lord you should have heard me scream
  - '"You know you''re leanin'' on my dream"'

  - Drivin' in a Chevy till my foreman get back
  - Suddenly I hear the break-man up and shout
  - There's a non-stop train comin' two miles out
  - Everybody jumpin' and a screaming around
  - Tryin' to get the line an get the teepee down
  - Railroad owner's 'bout to go insane

  - Where I could be and where I belong
  - Some always take, some have to win
  - They leave you with scars again and again
  - As they reach for the sky only to fall
  - They never change, I've seen them all
  - Let the rivers run like they always do
  - It's not up to me it's not up to you
  - When we reach the end when our time is done
  - Let us all be still while the rivers run
  - Let the rivers run from the great divide
  - I will stay with you I'll be by your side

  - The height of summer

  - Like a rock
  - I was eighteen

  - My eyes were clear and bright
  - My walk had purpose
  - My steps were quick and light
  - And I held firmly
  - To what I felt was right
  - Like a rock
  - Like a rock, I was strong as I could be
  - Like a rock, nothin' ever got to me
  - Like a rock, I was something to see
  - Like a rock
  - And I stood arrow straight
  - Unencumbered by the weight
  - Of all these hustlers and their schemes

  - High above it all
  - I still believed in my dreams
  - Twenty years now
  - Where'd they go?
  - Twenty years
  - I don't know
  - I sit and I wonder sometimes
  - Where they've gone
  - And sometimes late at night
  - Oh, when I'm bathed in the firelight
  - The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
  - And I recall
  - I recall
  - Like a rock, standin' arrow straight
  - Like a rock, chargin' from the gate
  - Like a rock, carryin' the weight
  - Like a rock
  - Oh, like a rock, the sun upon my skin
  - Like a rock, hard against the wind
  - Like a rock, I see myself again
  - Like a rock

  - So lonely, I'm a lonely man from Gainesville
  - (He ain't got nowhere to go), got nowhere to go
  - Said I don't want doin' wrong over this land
  - (Yes his blood is growin' cold), cold, gettin' colder
  - Yeah, I believe that all the people on the street
  - Take the time, time to stare
  - Not lonely in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere
  - Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander aimlessly
  - Lord it can't be
  - I don't want it to be my destiny
  - Lord, woman come an help me
  - Oh I wish that I could find me a turkey
  - (All he needs is good sweet love)
  - Yeah gotta go quack quack
  - Oh baby I would know in my heart I would be lucky
  - (That's the only way to go)
  - Yeah, be fine
  - Yeah, I wanna tell you that all the people on that street
  - They take the time to stare
  - I can see in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere
  - Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander 'round aimlessly
  - Can't be, can't be

  - We got better things to listen to
  - Lady from a church bizarre
  - Was smiling from her head to her feet
  - All the way down to her feet
  - That she couldn't see
  - She started speeking her piece
  - I said "Stop, Wait a minute, please
  - Before you start talkin'
  - I wish you'd please listen to me."

  - Through the long, lonely nights, she filled my sleep
  - Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
  - Down on Mainstreet
  - Down on Mainstreet
  - In the pool halls the hustlers and the losers
  - Used to watch 'em through the glass
  - Well, I'd stand outside at closing time
  - Just to watch her walk on past
  - Unlike all the other ladies she looked so young and sweet
  - As she made her way alone down that empty street
  - Down on Mainstreet
  - Down on Mainstreet
  - Sometimes even now when I'm feeling lonely and beat
  - I drift back in time and I find my feet
  - Down on Mainstreet

  - Living by the sword
  - And we'd steal away every chance we could
  - To the backrooms, an alley, or trusty woods

  - Waited on the thunder
  - Waited on the thunder
  - I woke last night to the sound of thunder
  - How far off, I sat and wondered
  - Started humming a song from 1962
  - Ain't it funny how the night moves
  - When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
  - Strange how the night moves
  - With autumn closing in
  - Mm, night moves

  - Headin' in or headin' out
  - Standing on the shore
  - Pause a moment to reflect
  - Which trip costs you more
  - Between the ever restless crowds
  - And the silence of your room
  - Spend an hour in no man's land
  - You'll be leaving soon
  - Victims come and victims go
  - There's always lots to spare
  - One victim lives the tragedy
  - One victim stops to stare
  - And still another walks on by
  - Pretending not to see
  - They're all out there in no man's land
  - '''Cause it''s the safest place to be'
  - But sanctuary never comes
  - Without some kind of risk
  - Illusions without freedom
  - Never quite add up to bliss
  - The haunting and the haunted
  - Play a game no one can win
  - The spirits come at midnight
  - And by dawn they're gone again
  - And so it seems our destiny
  - To search and never rest
  - To ride that ever changing wave
  - That never seems to crest
  - To shiver in the darkest night
  - Afraid to make a stand
  - And then go back and do our time
  - Out there in no man's land

  - No matter what you've done you'll have to start again
  - No matter who you are
  - Between the soaring dreams and the bottom line
  - So much is given up so much is left behind, yeah
  - This is the price you pay, this is the beast you feed
  - When you abandon hope and you give in to greed

  - When you didn't read the writing on the wall
  - It was forty years ago when I was young

  - Today's music ain't got the same soul
  - I like that old time rock and roll

  - With that old time rock and roll
  - Ow!
  - Won't go to hear 'em play a tango
  - I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
  - There's only one sure way to get me to go
  - Start playin' old time rock and roll
  - Call me a relic, call me what you will
  - Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill

  - He rises every morning but he don't look at the sun
  - He reaches in the corner where he keeps his loaded gun
  - Then he checks the firing action, as he straps it to his chest
  - Plans an ambush for the mailman, even though it's all in jest
  - He's here he's there he's everywhere
  - He's found uptown and underground
  - Unlike my friend flicka you know he's not a myth
  - He's persecution, persecution, persecution Smith
  - He's found at every protest march you'll see him looking on
  - He'd soon join in to help but he thinks it's all in fun
  - '''Cause he isn''t colorblind not to mention no one''s fool'
  - He knows how things should be but he ain't out to change no rules
  - His eyes can't see like you and me
  - His voice can't speak but only shriek
  - His brain is like jelly his muscles they are stiff
  - He's persecution, persecution, persecution Smith
  - You can't walk down the street no more without him walking by
  - You can't go to sleep at night without hearing him cry
  - You can't read a newspaper without reading about him
  - You can't escape him in the crowd for he will be among them
  - He's here he's there he's everywhere
  - He's found uptown and underground
  - In Watts, California you know who he was with
  - With persecution, persecution, persecution Smith
  - When you're finished with your ideals
  - And you're finished with your dreams
  - When you're finished your crusading and no longer hear the screams
  - When you're finished trying to picture a world with people free
  - When you're finished looking up and the down is all you see
  - Then make your goal the first foxhole
  - And hide your head beneath your bed

  - When the rain never got in my way

  - Some nights, Drifters playin' on the hi-fi
  - Talkin' 'bout girls, or preposterous lies
  - Laughin' hard, watchin' Soupy at eleven
  - Skonkin' down, one of Mom's lemon pies
  - Ten o'clock, bringin' groceries from the market
  - Singin' songs, to the darkness of the night
  - Even sang the parts the instruments were playing
  - Life was freer, dreams were really quite all right
  - Oh, Railroad days
  - Railroad days
  - Railroad days
  - When the sun seemed to smile on it's way
  - When the darkness was easier to play yeah
  - Oh in my younger railroad days
  - Yesterday, I heard they shut the trains down
  - The ones than ran, by the field where I would play
  - Said the folks want new and faster transportation
  - It's just like me, I'll be obsolete one day

  - I saw them standing on a corner
  - Bathed in ordinary light
  - They turned away and started walkin'
  - And faded off into the night
  - Some years ago they were in fashion
  - Tonight they couldn't get a seat
  - They've got themselves a brand new history
  - From Revisionism Street
  - Written on Revisionism Street
  - The years of sacrifice and struggle
  - The arc of stardom's natural course
  - The inevitable decline
  - The wolves waiting at the door
  - '"Let''s dig up something really nasty"'
  - '"Let''s get some clay around their feet"'
  - '"No one''s memory is sacred ''round here'
  - On Revisionism Street"
  - '"We''ll never be in the arena"'
  - '"Hey, we''ll never have to compete"'
  - '"We''ll never write a classic novel"'
  - '"And we''ll never have to be discreet!"'
  - Alfred Hitchcock, Isaac Newton
  - Elvis Presley, Captain Bligh
  - They're heroic or pathetic
  - Depending on which book you buy
  - Charles Dickens, Jackie Gleason
  - Burn 'em all, turn up the heat
  - If there's no truth, use innuendo
  - This is Revisionism Street
  - '"Let''s find ourselves some old acquaintance"'
  - '"Let''s see what they have to say"'
  - '"Some disgruntled ex-employee"'
  - '"Presto! Payday!"'
  - A tree falls in the forest
  - A million copies go to print
  - Some parasitic little feeder
  - Sits back and makes a mint
  - Somewhere a baby's softly sleeping
  - Lt's innocence complete
  - Unaware they're workin' late tonight
  - On Revisionism Street

  - Time to disconnect from clutter, time to hit the road
  - Ride out to a bold new horizon
  - Where the sun may be shinin'
  - On a place you've never seen
  - Ride out lift your soul and your spirit
  - Take a chance and get near it
  - Everybody needs a dream
  - Is the media for real do we fake or do we feel
  - Do we base all our appeal on a model or a myth
  - It's a market correction it's addiction resurrection
  - It's the last thing you mention before you knock it stiff
  - Ride out where the hills meet the valleys
  - Far from campaigns and rallies
  - And the things we do for oil
  - Ride out mix the real and imagined
  - With the lost and abandoned
  - And bring it to a boil
  - It takes your breath away
  - The way we pay and pay and pay and pay
  - You can take it to the masses you can run it up a pole
  - You can conquer all resistance and believe you're in control
  - But the world will be watchin' there's a crack in every lie
  - When it opens like a chasm you can kiss it all goodbye
  - Ride out to the high copper canyons
  - Past the shacks and the mansions
  - Where the rivers never end
  - Ride out past the peaks and the mesas
  - To the wide open spaces
  - You may never see again
  - Ride out to a brand new horizon
  - Where the sun may be shinin'
  - On a place you've never seen
  - Ride out lift your soul lift your spirt
  - Take a chance and get near it
  - Everybody needs a dream

  - Took a look down a westbound road
  - Right away I made my choice
  - Headed out to my big two-wheeler
  - I was tired of my own voice
  - Took a bead on the northern plains
  - And just rolled that power on
  - Twelve hours out of Mackinac City
  - Stopped in a bar to have a brew
  - Met a girl and we had a few drinks
  - And I told her what I'd decided to do
  - She looked out the window a long long moment
  - Then she looked into my eyes
  - She didn't have to say a thing
  - I knew what she was thinkin'
  - Roll, roll me away
  - Won't you roll me away tonight
  - I too am lost, I feel double-crossed
  - And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right
  - We never even said a word
  - We just walked out and got on that bike
  - And we rolled
  - And we rolled clean out of sight
  - We rolled across the high plains
  - Deep into the mountains
  - Felt so good to me
  - Finally feelin' free
  - Somewhere along a high road
  - The air began to turn cold
  - She said she missed her home
  - I headed on alone
  - Stood alone on a mountain top
  - Starin' out at the Great Divide
  - I could go east, I could go west
  - It was all up to me to decide
  - Just then I saw a young hawk flyin'
  - And my soul began to rise
  - And pretty soon
  - My heart was singin'
  - Roll, roll me away
  - I'm gonna roll me away tonight
  - Gotta keep rollin', gotta keep ridin'
  - Keep searchin' till I find what's right
  - And as the sunset faded I spoke
  - To the faintest first starlight
  - And I said next time
  - Next time
  - We'll get it right

  - A smoother operator you will never see
  - She'll see you later
  - And no one dares, dares debate her openly
  - She knows music
  - I know music too, you see
  - She's got the power
  - Of loyal teens - queen Rosalie
  - Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
  - She's got the classics
  - Comes from all the corners, corners of the world
  - So fantastic
  - She's everybody's favorite little record girl
  - She knows music
  - I know music too, you see
  - She's got the power, she's got the power, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
  - From chattanooga to good old bogalloosa
  - You can hear her fine
  - She makes her choices
  - And then you best be smilin' when it's choosin' time
  - She knows music
  - I know music too, you see
  - She's got the power, she's got the tower, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
  - Knows music, she knows music, she knows music

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bob_Seger:Runaway_Train
  - Sometimes I stumble, sometimes I fall
  - The angels of my nature won't accept the last call
  - I stop thinking, I just react
  - Before I know it everything turns black
  - I'm on a highway doing 90, utterly juiced
  - Out of control and impossibly loose
  - I'm comprehending without a clue
  - I don't know where I'm going, I don't know what I'm gonna do
  - I'm like a runaway train
  - Screaming through the back tent
  - Roaring through the rain
  - Like a runaway train
  - Maybe it's a full moon, baby, high-end tide
  - The fear of dying young, it makes me take that ride
  - I start up slowly building up steam
  - Before I know it all is illusion, it's like I'm in a dream
  - No man, no reason, nothing makes sense
  - No future, no past, only present tense
  - I'm out there floating completely alone
  - In a universe of chaos indifferent as a stone
  - Like a runaway train
  - Racing to the void
  - Roaring through the rain
  - Like a runaway train
  - I can't explain the unexplainable
  - Where's the electron gonna be next?
  - Do we really die for love and glory,
  - Or only for wealth and sex?
  - Is there a reason why I'm on this road?
  - Is it random or ordained?
  - Is everyone in the world dead today?
  - Am I the only that's saved?
  - We approach the speed of light, we approach infinite mass
  - We can't cross over, all our future becomes the past
  - It's nice to know those limits, nice to know those walls
  - But when you're on a bender you don't care about that at all
  - There's only moving forward, picking up speed
  - Moving feels like freedom, sometimes that's all you need
  - There's the wind in your hair, the cold on your brow
  - Nothing else matters, you're alive right now
  - Like a runaway train
  - Raging through the dark night
  - Roaring 'gainst the grain
  - Like a runaway train
  - Oh, runaway train
  - Oh, like a train
  - Runaway train
  - Runaway train
  - Runaway train
  - Runaway train

  - Like the wind that carried ahab
  - To a far, more distant shore
  - To a shipwreck that was certain
  - Long before
  - I can see there's no use sailing
  - Among ships I've known before
  - It will only bring me more
  - And more and more
  - Lonely sailing nights, more
  - Racing, dimming lights
  - Lonely nights, and all too
  - Familiar sights
  - Just as water seeks its level
  - So I only seek to live;
  - Hoping somehow I can find
  - A way to give
  - And the sea, it softly beckons
  - '"Come and go where you''ve not been."'
  - With the dawning of a new day
  - I'm gone, again
  - Lonely sailing nights, ... gone
  - Racing, dimming lights
  - Lonely nights
  - And all too
  - Familiar sights

  - A castle older than a redwood tree
  - Once lived in by royalty
  - Who taxed and raped the land
  - Mostly now it was stone and dust
  - Long damp halls and smells of must
  - Faded walls and ancient rust
  - Built on shifting sand
  - And I wanted, I wanted, I wanted
  - To smash that sucker down
  - It was a marvelous sight to see
  - A redhead workin' in a brasserie
  - Five foot nine built to a tee
  - Eyes so blue and bright
  - All the drunks were just circling round
  - I drank water and held my ground
  - Later on we did the town
  - And we caught every sight
  - '''Cause I wanted I wanted I wanted'
  - To follow her down
  - Sightseein' freein' my soul
  - Sightseein' leavin' my soul
  - It was a magical sight to me
  - And Yves Tanguy in a gallery
  - The 30's looking back at me
  - As if he really knew
  - I marveled at the artistry
  - Predating or technology
  - The vision there for all to see
  - Bold and strong and true
  - And I wanted I wanted I wanted
  - To take that painting home

  - I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around"

  - You always won every time you placed a bet
  - You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
  - Every time they were sure they had you caught
  - You were quicker than they thought
  - You'd just turn your back and walk
  - You always said the cards would never do you wrong
  - The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
  - A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
  - The only loss you could forsake
  - The only bluff you couldn't fake
  - And you're still the same
  - I caught up with you yesterday
  - Moving game to game
  - No one standing in your way
  - Turning on the charm
  - Long enough to get you by
  - You're still the same
  - You still aim high
  - There you stood, everybody watched you play
  - I just turned and walked away
  - I had nothing left to say
  - '''Cause you''re still the same'
  - You're still the same
  - Moving game to game
  - Some things never change
  - You're still the same

  - About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
  - I saw my first pistol in the general store
  - In the general store, when I was thirteen
  - Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
  - So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
  - Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
  - She really blew up and I didn't understand
  - Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
  - The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
  - Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
  - My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
  - Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
  - Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
  - It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
  - So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
  - Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
  - Never knew why, I didn't understand
  - '''Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil''s right hand'
  - Well I get into a card game in a company town
  - Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
  - Shot the dog down, watched the man fall
  - Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
  - The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
  - Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
  - Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
  - Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

  - Everything must have an end
  - Like an ocean to a shore
  - Like a river to a stream
  - Like a river to a stream
  - It's the famous final scene
  - And how you tried to make it work
  - Did you really think it could
  - How you tried to make it last
  - Did you really think it would
  - Like a guest who stayed too long
  - Now its finally time to leave
  - Yes, its finally time to leave
  - Take it calmly and serene
  - It's the famous final scene
  - It's been coming on so long
  - You were just the last to know
  - It's been a long time since you've smiled
  - Seems like oh so long ago
  - Now the stage has all been set
  - And the nights are growing cold
  - Soon the winter will be here
  - And there's no one warm to hold
  - Now the lines have all been read
  - And you knew them all by heart
  - Now you move toward the door
  - Here it comes the hardest part
  - Try the handle of the road

  - From the famous final scene

  - There go the street lights bringin' on the night
  - Here come the men faces hidden from the light
  - All through the shadows they come and they go
  - With only one thing in common
  - They got the fire down below
  - Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine
  - Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green
  - Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop
  - One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop
  - When it all gets too heavy
  - That's when they come and go
  - With only one thing in common
  - They got the fire down below
  - It happens out in Vegas happens in Moline
  - On the blue blood streets of Boston
  - Up in Berkeley and out in Queens
  - And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight
  - Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right
  - And he's looking out for Rosie and she's looking mighty fine
  - And he's walking the streets for Nancy
  - And he'll find her every time
  - When the street light flicker bringing on the night
  - Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight
  - All through the midnight
  - Watch 'em come and watch 'em go
  - With only one thing in common
  - They got the fire down below
  - Oh, burning down below
  - It happens out in Vegas, it happens in Moline

  - There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight
  - There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight
  - Through the concrete canyons to the midtown lights
  - Where the latest neon promises are burning bright
  - Past the open windows on the darker streets
  - Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry
  - Past the phony posers with their worn out lines
  - The tired new money dressed to the nines
  - The low life dealers with their bad designs
  - And the dilettantes with their open minds
  - You're out on the town, safe in the crowd
  - Ready to go for the ride
  - Searching the eyes, looking for clues
  - There's no way you can hide
  - The fire inside
  - Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques
  - Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises
  - Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks
  - Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious
  - And the lights go down and they dance real close
  - And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm
  - Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone
  - The darkness scatters as the lights flash on
  - They hold one another just a little too long
  - And they move apart and then move on
  - On to the street, on to the next
  - Safe in the knowledge that they tried
  - Faking the smile, hiding the pain
  - Never satisfied
  - The fire inside
  - Fire inside
  - Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep
  - You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave like you knew he would
  - You hear his car pull away in the street
  - Then you move to the door and you lock it when he's gone for good
  - Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon
  - Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky
  - And it comes to you how it all slips away
  - Youth and beauty are gone one day
  - No matter what you dream or feel or say
  - It ends in dust and disarray
  - Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass
  - Waves rolling in with the tide
  - Dreams die hard and we watch them erode
  - But we cannot be denied
  - The fire inside

  - A change is comin' it's on the way

  - It takes a hard look into your soul
  - It takes a ton of faith to push the doubt away
  - And reestablish full control
  - In a world of phony prophets
  - In a sea of plain conceit
  - Fight the wind and waves through the fog and haze
  - Until the good old earth's under your feet
  - You'll never know until you try
  - If you can reach beyond the sky
  - I'm packing up my gear
  - I'm getting out of here
  - Up where the air is clear
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - I need to turn the wheel
  - Away from every deal
  - Until I find what's real
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - I have lived among the missing
  - I have walked around asleep
  - I've been written off, I've been sold and bought
  - I have stared into the deep
  - There's a price for every promise
  - Every dream we victimize
  - A creative fate that you can't escape
  - Is the dreaded compromise
  - So much depends on what we say
  - When everyone gets in our way
  - I need to break the chains
  - I need to take the reins
  - And make a major change
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - I need to find the line
  - Between who's left behind
  - And who takes too much time
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - I'm packing up my gear
  - I'm getting out of here
  - Up where the air is clear
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - I need to turn the wheel
  - Away from every deal
  - Till I can find what's real
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway
  - Heading for the highway, heading for the highway

  - I think it's really come my way today babe
  - I think it's really you
  - I remember moments looking in your eyes
  - Could have sworn I saw the spark of love babe
  - Flickering inside
  - I've been around this track
  - And the only thing I lack
  - Is the real love
  - Every time I see you, every time we touch
  - I can feel the way you feel for me babe
  - And it means so much
  - And every time you look at me
  - It's just the way it all should be
  - In the real love
  - Oh darlin', darlin', darlin'
  - Stay with me stay
  - I long to see you in the morning sun
  - Everyday everyday
  - So until that moment
  - When I take your hand
  - I'm gonna try to do my very best babe
  - To prove that I'm your man
  - I'm gonna do my very best
  - I'm not gonna rest
  - Until we've got the real love
  - Real love
  - Until we've got the real love

  - By the light of the moon
  - To a 50s tune
  - He pledged his love to her
  - A girl so rare
  - A girl so fair
  - The girl for him for sure
  - He could see himself getting up every mornin' for the rest of his life
  - Just to look in those eyes so blue
  - It was all he ever wanted to do
  - She was all he'd ever need to see him through
  - They were still in their teens
  - When he gave her the ring
  - They were married late one May
  - And they moved into a little house
  - On the far end of town
  - Out by the big highway
  - And all through the days and all through the nights
  - The cars and the trucks rolled on by
  - And he slept through it all just fine
  - Every night he slept just fine
  - Sometimes she'd stare at the stars out the window
  - Sometimes she'd walk 'neath the moon
  - Sometimes she'd sit there just watching him sleeping
  - Hoping the dawn would come soon
  - She'd done well in school
  - She'd followed the rules
  - And she'd always stood out from the rest
  - She'd go off to college
  - And work her way through
  - Then move to some city out west
  - She had it all planned, she'd have her career
  - She'd have all of the things that she'd always lacked
  - She'd wake up one morning all packed
  - And leave here and never look back
  - Most of their friends thought it soon would be over
  - Not many thought it would last
  - Most seemed to think they were all wrong for each other
  - And soon it would pass, soon it would pass
  - Now twenty years have gone
  - And her kids have moved on
  - And she's still on the far end of town
  - Her youngest, she's livin' somewhere in L.A.
  - And her oldest, he works on a nearby farm
  - Her husband comes home and they talk over supper
  - He's usually the first to turn in
  - Another day comes to an end
  - Another day just ends
  - And sometimes in the wee hours when the traffic dies down
  - She'll hear the sound of some bird on the wing
  - And she'll look out the window and she'll look at his picture
  - But not at the ring, not at the ring
  - She never looks at the ring
  - Never looks at the ring
  - Never looks at the ring
  - Not at the ring

  - When you're out there on that open road
  - And you have no place to go
  - There's a solace in the emptiness
  - When there is no need to know
  - You can drift away
  - You can spend the day without things
  - When the night comes on
  - You can spend it without dreams
  - I can wave out on the open sea
  - I can cloud up in the sky
  - You can move away from earthly things
  - You don't have to say goodbye
  - When you're free of lies
  - You can leave your past behind you
  - Call a brand new course
  - Let it take you far away
  - You can sail the sea
  - You can sail the sea inside you
  - You can leave it all
  - You can leave it all behind
  - Yeah!
  - When you're out there in the emptiness
  - And your dreams have been denied
  - It's time to face the wilderness
  - And sail the sea inside

  - This old house was once for dancing
  - This old house once filled with joy
  - With its beauty so entrancing
  - Every little girl and boy
  - Now its halls are filled with darkness
  - Its rooms are dusty, cold
  - This old house is growing so old
  - Take a walk into the ballroom
  - Now it hardly looks the same
  - Now its chandelier is shattered
  - Only stillness here remains
  - Long ago there was the laughter
  - Through the stories that were told
  - This old house has grown so old
  - Carefull of the stairs
  - Don't sit on the broken chair
  - Peole passing by
  - Used to pause out in the square
  - Now they go on by
  - No one even stops to stare
  - It's so all alone
  - No one cares
  - They'll tear down this house come morning
  - Build a new one in its place
  - Put an end to all its glory
  - Put an end to all its grace
  - And the sun will set when evening comes
  - Stars will fill the sky
  - And stars will fill the sky

  - Saw you walkin' on a backstreet, honey
  - Tryin' to slip away
  - Did you find someone to take your money
  - And did it make your day
  - Take a lesson from someone who's been there
  - There are lots of roads that lead you nowhere
  - I can see it in your blank stare, baby
  - Someone's done you in
  - Everybody hits the hard truth some time
  - It's your time again
  - So you're lonesome and the night's approachin'
  - Honey, this is where the tough get goin'
  - Welcome to the tightrope
  - Between memory and pain
  - Welcome to the tightrope
  - Between the freedom and the chain
  - Welcome to the tightrope
  - Stretched high above the street
  - Welcome to the tightrope
  - It's right beneath your feet
  - Once you learn to balance truth and sorrow
  - You can worry about the rest tomorrow
  - Up there on the tightrope
  - Oh, it's a tightrope
  - You're walkin' on a tightrope

  - Take away my inhibitions
  - Take away my solitude
  - Fire me up with your resistance
  - Put me in the mood
  - Storm the walls around this prison
  - Leave the inmates
  - Free the guards
  - Deal me up another future
  - From some brand new deck of cards
  - Take the chip off of my shoulder
  - Smooth out all the lines
  - Take me out among the rustling pines
  - Till it shines
  - Like an echo down a canyon
  - Never coming back as clear
  - Lately I just judge the distance
  - Not the words I hear
  - I've been too long on these islands
  - I've been far too long alone
  - I've been too long without summer
  - In this winter home
  - Still if we can make the effort
  - If we take the time
  - Maybe we can leave this much behind
  - Till it shines
  - See the rich man lost and lonely
  - Watch him as he dines
  - Sitting there just testing all the wines

  - It won't save you from the sky
  - Let me see a show of hands
  - Tell me the truth now
  - What happens if
  - Neutrinos have mass
  - I can't tell you about tomorrow
  - I'm as lost as yesterday
  - In between your joy and sorrow

  - The sports section

  - And over in the teacher's home she waited by the phone
  - For calls which never rang, and people who never sang
  - Train man rambled dusty into town and made his daily round
  - Train man and he comes in the night
  - Brings her no love but he's right
  - Yes he's right
  - Through fog and misty morning dew, she'd seen his oily face
  - And he had touched her heart, taken it apart
  - Though he never stopped to speak a word his voice was all she heard
  - Train man and he comes in the night
  - Brings her no love but he's right
  - Yes he's right
  - Little girl you're a pretty little girl
  - Won't you come with me a while
  - Little girl in your frilly little world
  - Won't you give me your sweet smile
  - (First solo)
  - If you come tonight bring someone
  - If you come tonight bring someone
  - Don't come alone
  - If you come alone don't come
  - Don't come

  - On a long and lonesome highway
  - East of Omaha
  - You can listen to the engine
  - Moaning out its one-note song
  - You can think about the woman
  - Or the girl you knew the night before
  - But your thoughts will soon be wandering
  - The way they always do
  - When you're riding sixteen hours
  - And there's nothin' much to do
  - And you don't feel much like riding
  - You just wish the trip was through
  - Here I am, on the road again
  - There I am, up on the stage
  - Here I go, playing the star again
  - There I go -- turn the page
  - Well, you walk into a restaurant
  - Strung out from the road
  - And you feel the eyes upon you
  - As you're shakin' off the cold
  - You pretend it doesn't bother you
  - But you just want to explode
  - Most times you can't hear 'em talk
  - Other times you can
  - "All the same old clich\xE9s:"
  - '"Is that a woman or a man?"'
  - And you always seem outnumbered
  - So you don't dare make a stand
  - Here I am, on the road again
  - There I am, up on the stage
  - Here I go, playing the star again
  - There I go -- turn the page
  - Out there in the spotlight
  - You're a million miles away
  - Every ounce of energy
  - You try to give away
  - As the sweat pours out your body
  - Like the music that you play
  - Later in the evening
  - As you lie awake in bed
  - With the echoes from the amplifiers
  - Ringing in your head
  - You smoke the day's last cigarette
  - Remembering what she said
  - Here I am, on the road again
  - There I am, up on the stage
  - Here I go, playing the star again
  - There I go -- turn the page
  - Here I am, on the road again
  - There I am, up on the stage
  - Here I go, playing the star again
  - There I go

  - And the howling echoes louder, from the lonely hungry hounds
  - Vagrant winter's in the alley and he's waiting
  - And you my love come softly now and ease my troubled mind
  - As we huddle by the fireside slowly running out of time
  - Born December's children, learned to live without a sky
  - That's beneath the tallest buildings, even our childhood was a lie
  - Vagrant winter's at the door now and he's moaning
  - Come closer love and hold me, we may be the next in line
  - As we huddle by the fireside slowly running out of time
  - Vagrant winter's in the moon now and he's stealing
  - As long as you stay with me love, as long as you are mine
  - I can make it through the worst in the vagrant winter time

  - Springtime of new years, the young thoughts see more dreams
  - While you live on the wind, how lovely it all seems
  - With moments yet unshared, and wishes incomplete
  - The stars above your head, the world beneath your feet
  - Suddenly your nights, begin to seem so long
  - There's no one there to touch, when things start going wrong
  - You finally realise, you've never loved at all
  - And everywhere you look, you see the white wall
  - Your father's been too far, your mother's been too near
  - And now you're on your own, withdrawing in your fear
  - Through long and sleepless nights, the foxes are running free
  - You long to be with them, when the scare meets the sea
  - You climb and then you fall, and then you try again
  - You curse yourself aloud, for living so weird
  - And took it to the ground, your eyes are filled with tears
  - Imprisoned there you lay, in the autumn of your years

  - You can drink from the bottle no ice and no glass
  - You can lie in the mornin' and say it's our last
  - But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there
  - You can tell yourself different but you won't stop there
  - You can study the ancients, you can learn every fact
  - You can follow the cycles that leave and come back
  - How everything changes, it's been ever thus
  - One day you're a comet the next day you're dust
  - But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there
  - There's always the future and you won't stop there
  - Tyrants and kings do their usual things
  - And you try to stay out of their way
  - Follow the truth and you'll find what you need every day
  - There's always tomorrow, always a chance
  - You can stand in the spotlight and not have to dance
  - You can find something solid, stronger than steel
  - And it might touch your heart 'cause it just might be real
  - But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there
  - It's not in your nature and you won't stop there
  - No you won't stop there, no you won't stop there
  - There's always tomorrow so you won't stop there.

  - Order me case of your southern soul
  - And let me out tonight
  - I need a good, long ride on your rodeo

  - A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
  - The sky is starlit and the time is right
  - And still you're tellin' me you have to go
  - Before you leave there's something you should know
  - Yeah something you should know babe
  - I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
  - I've seen your long hair flying when you run
  - I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
  - You're high above me now, you're wild and free ah but
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Some people say that love's a losin' game
  - You start with fire but you lose the flame
  - The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
  - You end up cold and lonely on your own
  - I'll take my chances babe I'll risk it all
  - I'll win your love or I'll take the fall
  - I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - It's written down some where, it's got to be
  - You're high above me flyin' wild and free
  - Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
  - I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be
  - Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
  - Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

  - With good acting

  - Too bad the sponsers had to go
  - And you know who you are

  - The sound was bad

  - But then what were we doing on the stage
  - And you know who you are
  - Oh yeah
  - Tell me if it feels like the key
  - Well it's easy too easy
  - '''Cause when I saw you there'
  - With your eyes in the air
  - Ah
  - Everything we done we done before
  - Somehow it seemed to make a little more sense
  - It was such a close call I think that's why I'm writing this at all

  - I've got a friend you take me in
  - These are the hours, this is our time
  - I'm in your universe you are in mine

  - Having a vision and knowing it's real

  - As we come marching, marching in the beauty of the day
  - A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray
  - Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses
  - 'For the people hear us singing: "Bread and roses! Bread and roses!"'
  - As we come marching, marching, we battle too for men
  - For they are women's children, and we mother them again
  - Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes
  - Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses
  - As we come marching, marching, unnumbered women dead
  - Go crying through our singing their ancient song for bread
  - Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew
  - Yes, it is bread we fight for -- but we fight for roses, too
  - As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days
  - The rising of the women means the rising of the race
  - No more the drudge and idler -- ten that toil where one reposes
  - 'But a sharing of life''s glories: Bread and roses! Bread and roses'

  - As the snow flies

  - A poor little baby child is born
  - In the ghetto
  - And his mama cries
  - Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
  - It's another hungry mouth to feed
  - In the ghetto
  - (In the ghetto)
  - People, don't you understand
  - The child needs a helping hand
  - Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
  - Take a look at you and me
  - Are we too blind to see
  - Do we simply turn our heads
  - And look the other way
  - Well the world turns
  - And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
  - Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
  - In the ghetto
  - (In the ghetto)
  - And his hunger burns
  - So he starts to roam the streets at night
  - And he learns how to steal
  - And he learns how to fight
  - In the ghetto
  - (In the ghetto)
  - Then one night in desperation
  - A young man breaks away
  - He buys a gun, he steals a car
  - He tries to run, but he don't get far
  - And his mama cries
  - As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
  - Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
  - In the ghetto
  - (In the ghetto)
  - As her young man dies
  - (In the ghetto)
  - On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
  - Another little baby child is born
  - In the ghetto
  - (In the ghetto)
  - And his mama cries

  - They only want to see the side of me that they pay to see
  - But you get that free baby, but you get the worst side of me
  - The things that are lost along the way took a whole lot out of me
  - I had become so blind that I've lost all reality
  - Oh, I can remember when they said you were through
  - But I never never never gave up on you (no you didn't baby)
  - Baby I've seen you I've seen you at your worst
  - But baby baby didn't we make it through
  - Oh, but sometimes sometimes you made me feel so insecure
  - You can always, you can always, you can always rest assured
  - No mattter how high I get I'll still be looking up to you
  - No mattter how high I get I'll still be looking up to you
  - Oh yes I will Bobby

  - Born by the river in a little tent
  - And just like the river, I've been running ever since
  - It's been a long time coming
  - But I know a change is gonna come
  - It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
  - I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
  - It's been a long time coming
  - But I know a change is gonna come
  - I go to the movie, and I go downtown
  - Somebody keep telling me "Don't hang around"
  - It's been a long time coming
  - But I know a change is gonna come
  - Then I go to my brother and I say, "Brother, help me please"
  - But he winds up knocking me back down on my knees
  - There've been times that I've thought I couldn't last for long
  - But now I think I'm able to carry on
  - It's been a long time coming
  - But I know a change is gonna come

  - When you walk down the street
  - Oh, a woman wants to hear that
  - Fellas, I'm here to tell you

  - And if you want to keep her
  - Make sure you keep her believin'
  - Believin', believin', believin'

  - But when you come home late for dinner
  - Put some weak alibi

  - The earth is but a dayglo reflection
  - Like turn that with rain you only light
  - I'm falling to myself but I'm not going
  - Waiting for the day to bring me light
  - Is everything, is that everything, is everything
  - The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
  - '''Cause I''ve laid down I take you down'
  - And I love it every step of your way
  - Watching from a distant constellation
  - Eyes I can see the world unchanging hills
  - There's still unfalling waiting
  - Time with you is that love is the only truth
  - Is everything, is that everything, is everything
  - The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
  - '''Cause I''ve laid down I take you down'
  - And I love it every step of your way

  - I can't seem to believe myself
  - Here I go again,
  - Here I go again
  - Here I go again
  - Listen to me now
  - It's five o'clock AM and the party
  - Is still going strong, there's a
  - Conversation going in the corner
  - Big Ed is all on the lawn
  - And the FM music is groovin'
  - Folks getting down, getting down
  - In their stocking feet
  - Sleepy eyes are peeping
  - From the window across the street
  - And it looks like daylight's
  - Gonna catch me up again
  - Most people like getting up
  - When I'm just getting in
  - Oh, it's the only, only time
  - It seems to be the only time
  - When I can unwind
  - Swore to myself
  - Time and time, and time again
  - That I would give up the nightlife
  - And start layin' in
  - But it ain't easy no, no
  - Sayin' no to my friends
  - '''Cause the real'
  - '''Cause the real set don''t get started'
  - Till everyone else is in
  - And it looks like daylight's
  - Gonna catch me up again
  - Most people like getting up
  - When I'm just getting in
  - Oh, it's the only, only time

  - Why don't you just take a little time to look on the good side my friend

  - Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
  - Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
  - I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
  - I just can't remember who to send it to
  - I've seen fire and I've seen rain
  - I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
  - I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
  - But I always thought that I'd see you again
  - Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
  - You've got to help me make a stand
  - You've just got to see me through another day
  - My body's aching and my time is at hand
  - I won't make it any other way
  - I've seen fire and I've seen rain
  - I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
  - I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
  - But I always thought that I'd see you again
  - Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
  - Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
  - Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
  - Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
  - I've seen fire and I've seen rain
  - I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
  - I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
  - But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
  - Thought I'd see you one more time again
  - There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
  - Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
  - I've seen fire and I've seen rain
  - I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
  - I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
  - But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now
  - Thought I'd see you one more time again

  - Lookin' back on my yesterdays
  - True love didn't go that away, I can remember it Well, now
  - Once you said you love somebody
  - That vow, you couldn't dare to break
  - I don't understand it, that's what you've done
  - How could you break my heart, How could you break my heart

  - How could you break my heart, Mean what you said from the start

  - See, It wasn't no big thing to me, no way
  - See, I've had a whole lot of oil around, you know
  - I mean, a whole lots of things around
  - I can think of a few things
  - That I would'nt mind being between, She did too
  - But, oh, after the three minute spill

  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Listen to me
  - It's only been a week ago
  - But it seems like years
  - And it's getting sort of hard
  - To see through tears
  - '''Cause now you''re gone'
  - And I know for myself
  - That I can't find happiness
  - With nobody else
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Listen to me
  - I find myself calling out your name
  - In the middle of the night
  - And I still hear you saying, darling
  - No, no, two wrongs don't make it right
  - I thought I could cope it all alone
  - But I was so wrong
  - '''Cause it didn''t gain me one solitary thing'
  - But an unhappy home
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - I wanna say sorry
  - Oh, but it ain't a strong enough word
  - For once in my life I'm so sincere
  - And I mean every word
  - I listen to what my friends had to say
  - But ooh, they messed me up again
  - '''Cause I haven''t seen a good day, baby'
  - Since you know when
  - I never thought it could ever
  - Affect me this way
  - But I'm drownin' in a sea of misery
  - And all I can think of to say
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - I've got to keep on singing
  - Oh, how I miss you, baby
  - I swear, I swear

  - He knows he can trust me with his life
  - But he's tryin' to leave me alone
  - Leaves me alone with his wife
  - I wish he didn't trust me so much
  - I think he really trusts me too much
  - How can he be so blind?
  - We've both got the same good taste
  - He should know when he's gone on his business trips
  - I can't help watchin' his woman
  - '''Cause I''m losin'' my grip'
  - I wish he didn't trust me so much
  - I think he really trusts me too much
  - Though I swear, all is not my will
  - But there's a way
  - There's a way she make me feel
  - Lord, I'm scared, so scared of what I do
  - If she starts feelin' same way too
  - You shouldn't trust me so much
  - (We got a problem)
  - I think you really trust me too much
  - It's not that she leads me on
  - I'm gettin' there all by myself
  - But just being with her all, all alone
  - I can't help but hopin'
  - That he never comes home
  - I wish he didn't trust me so much
  - I think you really trust me too much
  - I wish he didn't trust me so much
  - (We got a problem)
  - I think you really trust me too much
  - Though I swear, all is not my will
  - (Is not my will)
  - But it's somethin' about the way
  - The way she makes me feel
  - Lord, I'm so scared, scared of what I do
  - If she starts feelin' the same way too
  - I wish he didn't trust me so much
  - (Ooh)
  - I think he really trusts me too much
  - (I got a problem)
  - You can see, I'm caught up
  - (I wish he didn't trust me so much)
  - Caught up in the middle
  - (I think he really trusts me too much)
  - 'And I''m down, tired of playing '

  - Made me work so hard to reach you

  - Haaaah Hah (Bobby laughs)
  - You gotta learn today to look at things right on -- Ooh yeah (chorus sings)
  - Black is Black, White is White, that's a proven fact --
  - And even goes the same -- when it comes down to a woman
  - The greatest gift god could give man, Me and You
  - Y'all can understand where I'm comin' from
  - You've got somebody that you love -- I don't believe in playin' hard to get
  - For somebody you might already have -- Listen to Me
  - (Chorus) Ooh
  - You gotta stop fussin' over the ladies
  - Beatin' 'em and mistreatin' em
  - And leaving them with a baby
  - Ya gotta start them right
  - Huggin and lovin' and bein real nice
  - Although at times -- they be tempting
  - And sometimes they get ya' old and grey
  - But a woman was made to love
  - One change in this sound like a sleigh
  - What I'm tryin' to say, Yaalll
  - If you can't give her love --
  - Give her up
  - And If You can't give her up -- make up your mind -- Oh
  - Give her up -- or give her her freedom
  - I don't mean that a woman run wild
  - And get a job every once in a while -- Ooh
  - Don't get up -- get her up at home
  - Cause you don't want to hurt == just leave her alone
  - There's a lot of men -- I don't know
  - That would like to be your ---
  - Who would accept a ready made family
  - And be the things for ya' woman that you should be doing --
  - Heeey, Heey
  - If you can't give her love --
  - Give her up
  - And If You can't give her up -- make up your mind -- Oh
  - Give her up -- or give her her freedom
  - Oh, Baby -- My, My My, My, My ba-by

  - I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
  - And I expect that might be the whole world
  - Because everybody needs something or someone to love
  - When it's cold outside who are you holding?
  - You know, if y'all don't mind I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
  - She's always complainin' 'bout me never bein' at home
  - But when I'm down broke
  - She's tellin' me about the things that her girlfriend's got
  - What she ain't got and she wants me to go out and get 'em for her
  - But girl, I can't be in two places at one time
  - If you think you're lonely now, huh
  - Wait until tonight, girl
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - I'll be long gone
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - And you'll find another man that'll treat you right
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - When I ain't there to rub your back
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - Just remember I made it a long fact
  - And it's gotta just come out of the closet
  - And chase you all around your room
  - And the memories sail 'round like a ghost
  - And that's a matter of fact, no joke, ah
  - If you think you're lonely now
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - Oh, wait until tonight
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - I'll be long gone
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right
  - (You just wait until tonight, girl)
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - You think you're lonely now
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - Wait, wait, wait until tonight, girl
  - Oh, ain't it funny how the tables turn
  - When things aren't goin' your way?
  - But when love runs out and the pain walks in
  - And settles for a stay, ooh
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - Lord, help me, I feel like I wanna testify
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - Girl, wait until tonight
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - If you think you're lonely, lonely now
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - Oh, you just wait until tonight, girl
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - You see tonight's the night when the needs come out
  - When your needs come out to breathe
  - And you toast the stars and there ain't now way you can sleep, ooh
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - If you think you're lonely now
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - I feel like I wanna testify this evenin'

  - Wait
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - Too far gone
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - Like you're runnin' out
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, babe
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - You say you're a little lonely
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - But everybody needs somebody to love
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side
  - That'll build you up when you're fallin' down
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - And you had that someone, baby
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - '''Cause I''ve done my time'
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - And it's your turn now
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - If you think you're lonely now
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - Wait, wait until tonight
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - I'm tired, tired of this same old stuck in the hour
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - It's been too long
  - (If you think you're lonely now)
  - You think, you could start all over again, it's been too long
  - (Wait until tonight, girl)
  - You think you could start it just one more time
  - (If you think you're lonely now)

  - Well, baby used to stay out all night long
  - She made me cry, she did me wrong
  - She had my nose open, that's no lie
  - Tables turn and now it's her turn to cry
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
  - Well, she used to run around with every man in town
  - She spent all my money, trying to play her high class game
  - She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
  - Tables turn and now her turn to cry
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
  - Well, I used to wake up in the morning, and get my breakfast in bed
  - When I'd gotten worried she would rub my aching head
  - But now she's here and there, with every man in town
  - She's still trying to take me for that same old clown
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
  - Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

  - (Bobby's Monolouge)
  - You know, people always ask me say, "Bobby why do you always talk before you sing?
    You know like I notice in most of your songs, you always have somethin' to say."
    People that talk usually I think that you should have somethin' to say, or you
    shouldn't talk just to be talkin'. But I feel that anytime I got somethin' to
    say Imma say it, 'cause I cause maybe it'll help you on your merry way.
  - Like I'm an entertainer, I'm in show business, and I like to speak for all people
    that's in show business, lot of people don't understand. They look at us different,
    but there's no difference we need the same thing, that you need. It's simple like,
    let's say if you were away from home, know what I mean? And uh, you make home,
    or you try, or you make an attempt to make home, where it was, know what I mean?
    Where it is.
  - So like uh, so like a few days ago, I was in uh, Chicago, and after the show I
    had previously I had seen this young lady sitting backstage and she was uh, seem
    like she had a whole lot of time on her hands, or I didn't know. So after the
    show, I was a little lonely and I didn't want to go back to the hotel by myself,
    and I had been feeling her vibe all through the whole night, so I said," Hey Baby
    what're you doin' after the show?" She said'"Oh I ain't doin' nothin'."
  - I said,"Well dig, like I'm at the Holiday Inn room 234, why don't you stop by
    and have a drink?" She said,"Aw you don't wanna buy me no drink, you can buy me
    a drink right here." Said,"You just wanna get me up in your room." You know? And
    so many times this is said to entertainers and it makes 'em feel so bad, you know
    what I mean?
  - It's like, I've always been the kind of person if that was the case I would tell
    you,"Yes I want you in my room." The only reason you'd be hangin' around was because
    you would want to be there anyway, or was waitin on an opportunity if that was
    the case. Know what I mean? See what people gotta learn is to start doing is don't
    d-don't don't be jivin yourself, you can't fool yourself. You know? I'm just gon,
    if I if if I want water, I'm gon ask for water I'll say,"Say I'm thirsty." You
    know what I mean? But the whole thing to all of this is just that, you know Imma
    be gone tomorrow, I mean even if I wanted to stay my job won't permit me to. You
    know what I mean? It gets real technical, it gets down in the contract, agencies.
    People like that you know? And it's all about money, and it seems, but with me
    it's all about feelings.
  - I don't wanna get you involved, I don't wanna mess up your life if you got somethin'
    goin', like keep a man, it's cool to have a man from 9 to 5. Ain't nothin' wrong
    with that. Like I say, don't get hung up on me, cause tomorrow I might be gone
    on down the road. It's cool if you can handle it, if you got a good man remember
    one thing.
  - (End of Monolouge)
  - (Bobby sings)
  - Oh, he'll be there, when your sun go down
  - And I'll be somewhere runnin' down that same old line
  - In another town
  - I thought I'd let you know, where I'm comin' from
  - I don't really mean you no wrong,
  - But I gotta keep movin on, gotta keep movin on
  - And he'll be there when your lights go dim,
  - So why chase me up and down the road,
  - And in your mind you know you should be with him' oh
  - I can't help, but we can't help what we feel inside, baby,
  - Wanna let it out, be we all hung up on pride
  - But oh pride can't fulfill the need inside,
  - Come and get it, go on home, but leave it outside
  - Oh
  - '''Cause he''ll be there, (I''m just tellin'' you like it is)'
  - When the sun go down
  - You ain't always be sweet sixteen, so while you still caryin little weight, find
    you somebody that's gon really mean you some good.
  - Mmmmmm. Listen to me.
  - But don't get me wrong,
  - I fall in love like any other man do.
  - But I gotta keep movin from place to place,
  - And in my heart, I might just wanna be with you
  - I have to get it where I can,

  - Hello, Hello
  - How are you?
  - I wonder if I can borrow about 10 minutes of your time?
  - Ya know how it is when you feel all alone
  - And you feel like you got to talk to somebody
  - I want to talk to you
  - Listen to me a minute
  - Sittin' here sippin' on a glass of wine
  - And I'm trying my best, not to lose my mind
  - Not to lose my mind
  - You know, thinkin' about the word. huh, "commercial"
  - It's a funny, funny, funny word!
  - Ya' know what's funnier than that
  - You show people usin'
  - You know what I'm talkin' about,
  - Like, uh, record companies, presdients
  - Vice presidents, producers
  - And a little engineer
  - But, you know what? I feel, down in my heart
  - I don't care what it is,
  - If I can get into it, it's commercial enough for me
  - But anyway, I remember just a little while back
  - I walked into a recording studio with just
  - Me and my guitar
  - I remember starting out on song
  - Sort of went something like this,
  - But other than that, the same melody, anyway
  - The head man called in, president,
  - Vice President, and just one of his producers
  - And an engineer
  - And an engineer
  - Anyway, they all sit around
  - With their heads dropped down
  - While I was tryin' to get over, Heh
  - You could hear a pin fall
  - I know y'all know what I'm talking about
  - And I'm steady trying to get over
  - But anyway, after I got through doing my thing
  - Or should I say, doing the best that I could
  - I'd never forget what they told me
  - One of the cats got up and say
  - '"I like ya, and I ain''t sayin'' that you can''t sing"'
  - And as they all began to leave the conference table
  - They kept saying (beginning to sing)
  - '"But you''re not commercial, commercial'
  - Commercial
  - No, You're not commercial!"
  - So, I went on out
  - Or, should I say, I "Souled Out"
  - Like I've said before
  - Music is Music, that's how it is
  - And that's the way it is
  - Well, I done changed my style
  - Because I still had the same heart
  - But, just like the man said
  - He said "Bobby, It's gotta be funky!"
  - I came back and said, Now I wanna sing
  - Something that I wanna sing, a little song that says, uh
  - It says, Uh, (Going into the song)
  - Why do birds suddenly appear, ev'ry time you're near?
  - Just like me, they long to be close to you, yeah
  - Why do stars fall down from the sky, every time you walk by?
  - Just like me, can't you see, they just want to be close to you, yeah
  - Listen to me a minute
  - Oh the day that you were born the angels got together
  - And decided to create a dream come true
  - So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
  - Of gold, and star-light in your eyes
  - Of blue! blue!
  - That is why all the guys in town follow you
  - Follow you around, follow you around, follow you around
  - Just like me, they just want to be close to you
  - Why do stars fall down from the sky, every time you walk by, yeah
  - Just like me, they just want to be
  - A little bit closer to you
  - Oh the day that you were born
  - -- The angels got together and decided to create a dream come true
  - So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
  - And I see rainbows when I look at you
  - That is why all the guys in town
  - Follow you, you around
  - Just like me, they long to be, closer to you
  - I think I got a reason to say
  - I wanna be closer to you!
  - Lemme say it one mooorrre time
  - One more time
  - I'll go anywhere you want me to go
  - Buy ya anything that you want me to buy!

  - Something in the way she moves
  - Attracts me like no other lover

  - I don't want to leave her now

  - Something in her style that shows me
  - Don't want to leave her now
  - You know I believe her now
  - You're asking me will my love grow
  - I don't know, I don't know
  - You stick around now it may show
  - I don't know, I don't know

  - Preacher is preaching
  - How you should live
  - Instead of teaching
  - With the love they give
  - They ask for money
  - In the name of the Lord
  - And they line their pockets; keep coming back for more
  - Dragging you down
  - Chipping away
  - Misleading you all with the things they say
  - What they feed you
  - Strive to believe
  - Giving you just enough to make you needy
  - By the time you wake up they're already gone
  - Looking for the next fool to come along
  - Dragging you down.
  - Chipping away
  - Misleading you all with the things they say
  - Shatters your world
  - Spoiling your mind
  - Keeping your heart
  - Prayer divine
  - Dragging you down
  - Chipping away
  - Misleading you all with the things they say
  - Shatters your heart

  - No one was there, I had wasted my time.

  - It brought us to this, and oh baby
  - This is our final destiny

  - Where, ooh I'd like to know
  - Some times you build me up, sometimes you build me up
  - You build me up just to let me down, girl

  - Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
  - He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
  - But you can do the job when you're in town
  - Later on we'll conspire
  - As we dream by the fire
  - To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
  - Walking in a winter wonderland
  - It's a soft sheet kind of a thing
  - Makes you wanna do your thing
  - In the meadow we can build a snowman

    we have the tendency, or should I say we forget, what a woman needs every now
    and then. That is, if you wanna keep your thing together.

  - Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
  - Say the things that make her feel better everyday
  - Then you got to stay on your Ps and Qs
  - If you don't, the woman you can easily lose
  - Whoa, oh, I had a love and I lost her
  - And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
  - Oh, a woman's gotta have it
  - I believe, she's gotta know that she's needed around
  - When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it
  - Every time boy,
  - She wants to know that she's not walkin' on shaky ground
  - Oh, yeah
  - Well, think it over
  - Think it over, my brother
  - Don't take for granted the smile on her face
  - Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
  - Maybe the girl might never say a mumbling word
  - But you gotta make sure that her voice is heard
  - Whoa, oh, I had a love and I lost her
  - And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
  - Oh, a woman's gotta have it
  - I believe, she's gotta know that she's needed around
  - When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it
  - Every time boy
  - She wants to know that she's not walkin' on shaky ground
  - So if you've got a love
  - And you wanna keep her
  - You got to give her what she wants when she wants it
  - Where she wants it
  - And how she wants it
  - Every doggone time she feels she needs it

  - I lay down beside of a great big tree
  - And I soon was fast asleep
  - I dreamed I was sittin' in a swell cafe
  - Just as hungry as a bear

  - Woh, my
  - Yessir, when you really know how
  - And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be
  - When we finally know how
  - We'll get a house in town, no need to move around
  - When we really know how
  - Well, there's tricks that I don't even know
  - Ones we'll make up as we go
  - Woh, mister, when we really know how
  - Yes, mister, when we really know how

  - Struck by the moon, rising too soon
  - I feel a pain deep inside me
  - Cold northern wind, a fist in my chin
  - Makin' me wild for you baby
  - What can I do to get back to you
  - I'm feelin' desperate and lonely
  - The city's a river of cold misery
  - Makin' me wild for you baby
  - I'm down on my knees
  - Hear me cry for you baby
  - Cold misery
  - I would die for you baby
  - I pray you will see
  - These tears I cry
  - Nights I can't sleep, my tears are cheap
  - I'm losin' hold of my senses
  - I can't contain all of this pain
  - And it's makin' me wild for you baby

  - I never thought that a love could be so strong
  - It could ever make me, think about leaving home
  - I can't help myself your lovin' bout to drive me mad
  - One more night like last night, I might have to pack my bags
  - Bout to make me leave home boy
  - Got my mind so
  - Gettin' together with this love, boy it just ain't right
  - I ain't got the strength to turn a good lovin' loose
  - But I never met a man in my life who could whoop it to me like you do
  - Bout to make me leave home boy
  - Got a taste of forbidden fruit
  - And I can't turn it loose
  - What is this good thing you carry around with you
  - That makes a girl want to act a fool
  - Got that love technique that really really cracks me up
  - Seeing you once or twice a week, boy it just ain't enough.

  - Had a fight with my daughter,
  - She flew off in rage.
  - Third time this week,
  - Don't tell me it's the age.
  - Don't know how I've lost her,
  - Only know that it's a shame.
  - Ever since her daddy left,
  - The girl ain't been the same.
  - All at once I hear your voice,
  - And time just slips away.
  - Nothing they can say can hold me here.
  - Take me where I only feel,
  - The wind across my face.
  - Let me know there's some place left for me.
  - Waiting there for me...
  - Aww, who'm I kidding?
  - I should've known he'd never leave.
  - The time we spend together,
  - Is harder than the time between.
  - You wouldn't think it could hurt so,
  - To see them out the other day.
  - If that's what he calls leaving...
  - I guess I threw it all away.
  - They say women, we're the stronger.
  - Somehow we always make it through.
  - Well, that ain't what I feel right now.
  - I don't even think it's true.
  - To me there's lots more broken,
  - Than anyone can really see.
  - Why the angels turn their backs on some;
  - It's a mystery to me.

  - When I was a young girl
  - I had me a cowboy
  - He weren't much to look at

  - And no matter how I tried
  - The years just flow by

  - That I can hold on to
  - To believe in this livin'
  - Is just a hard way to go
  - There's flies in the kitchen
  - I can hear all their buzzin'
  - And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
  - How the hell can a person
  - Go to work in the morning
  - Come home in the evening
  - And have nothing to say

  - 'I want to feel my earth turn over, baby '
  - In this hardened Winter ground
  - Feel my earth turn over, darling
  - '''Til I''m rootless and unbound'
  - I want to feel my body tremble
  - When there's no one else around
  - Just this cool, clear water running
  - In this love that I've found
  - Hey, baby
  - See how it can be
  - Every time you reveal yourself to me
  - I'll come running
  - I want to feel myself go under, baby
  - Where the deepest river bleeds
  - I want to feel it pull me under, darling
  - Until it drops me to my knees
  - I want to know that I can find you
  - When there's no more eyes to see
  - In this cool, clear water running
  - You'll come running to me
  - Hey, baby
  - 'All my life I have known there''s something more '
  - A love to blind me like the Sun
  - Deep in dreams, I will wash up on your shore
  - Now I know that you're the one
  - When I feel my baby calling
  - It's like a whisper in the sand
  - And when the softest rain is falling, darling
  - I will crumble in your hand
  - And when all that's left is wonder
  - And no need to understand
  - Well, this cool, clear water running
  - Will be all that I am

  - My body is the only place
  - Where we meet anymore
  - Thought that I could handle the heartache
  - Like I did before
  - I remember your warning
  - To never mention love
  - A little crime of passion
  - Is what I'm guilty of
  - There were no witnesses
  - Just the candlelight
  - Glowin' as your sweetness awakened
  - Every warm delight
  - Show me some mercy
  - What a fool I have become
  - A little crime of passion
  - That's what I'm sufferin' from
  - Kisses ago it was so easy
  - Dreams we shared together faded to forever
  - And I just don't wear despair very well
  - I can tell
  - Now it's such a painful time
  - And I'm too far gone
  - Where are all the clever defenses
  - I depended on?
  - How could I be so crazy
  - To believe all the things you say?
  - A little crime of passion
  - Is takin' my breath away
  - Show me some mercy
  - What a fool I've become
  - A little crime of passion
  - That's what I'm sufferin' from
  - Baby, oh, just a little crime of passion

  - I could say what I mean
  - (Or I could dance around it)
  - It would feel good to scream
  - (I should quiet down)
  - I could be recognized
  - (Or I could stay in bed)
  - Look the world in the eyes
  - (Or just hang my head)
  - I'm holding steady this crooked crown
  - Knowing I'll lose it if I look down
  - When my ship has come in
  - (When it runs aground)
  - I'll be smiling again
  - (Turn those corners down)
  - I've got something to say
  - (No one's listening)
  - It's my reckoning day
  - (So where's the reckoning?)
  - I'm holding steady this crooked crown
  - Knowing I'll lose it if I look down
  - I'm holding steady this crooked crown
  - My prodigy and my idiot play
  - For the prize of my delicate line
  - Somehow the score at the end of
  - The day is still 51-49
  - I'm holding steady this crooked crown
  - Knowing I'll lose it if I look down
  - I'm holding steady this crooked crown

  - I know it's useless to be jealous, I couldn't tire you if I tried,
  - But when I think of you messing behind my back
  - It brings a pain I just can't hide.
  - Oh baby, I've been true to you.
  - And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too.
  - Well, you come home drunk and nasty, you won't tell me where you've been.
  - Just when things are nice and sweet, you go back out again.
  - Why do you wanna mess up a good thing?
  - I'm gonna find me another man, one who wants to give me everything.
  - Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,
  - If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door.
  - Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know.
  - Oh honey, if you want me to love you,
  - You've got to give it up or let me go

  - Darkness settles on the ground
  - Leaves the day stumbling blind
  - Coming to a quite close
  - And maybe just in time
  - We've almost the heart to know
  - How to keep our best in mind
  - We've almost the heart to know
  - How to keep our best in mind
  - Time has turned an angry face
  - Throws a dark eye back to sea
  - But what will pass for mercy now
  - We'll practice unforgivingly
  - As if might and will make right
  - Or either one could make us free
  - As if might and will make right
  - Or either one could make us free
  - Lovers laugh and cross this way
  - A-weavin' out into the street
  - It seems we never were so young
  - Or it was never quite so sweet
  - But the world is always beautiful
  - When it's seen in full retreat
  - The worst of life looks beautiful
  - As it slips away in full retreat
  - God only knows what we can do
  - No more or less than he'll allow
  - God only knows that we mean well
  - God knows that we just don't know how
  - But I try to be your light and love
  - Pray that it's enough for now
  - Well, I tried to be your light and love
  - And I'll pray that is enough for now

  - God was in the water that day
  - Pickin' through the roots and stones
  - Trippin' over sunken logs
  - Tryin' not to make his presence known
  - God was in the water that day
  - Wadin' in careful steps
  - Bubbles risin' from his feet
  - Comin' up from the muddy depths
  - Castin' out a line
  - Castin' out a line to the shadows
  - Castin' out a line but no one's biting
  - I am at my pitiful desk
  - Starin' at he colorless walls
  - Wishin' I was any place else
  - Down into a dream I fall
  - Sittin' in a tiny boat
  - Driftin' on the mindless sea
  - And if I disappear
  - At least I'm floating free
  - Castin' out a line
  - Castin' out a line to the darkness
  - Castin' out a line but no one's biting
  - God was in the air that day
  - Breathin' out a haunted breeze
  - Tryin' not to make a sound
  - Shufflin' through the dried up leaves
  - God was in the air that day
  - Circlin' like a drunken hawk
  - Sweepin' with a hungry eye
  - Over the ground I walk
  - Castin' out a line
  - Castin' out a line to the darkness
  - Castin' out a line but no one's biting
  - Castin' out a line

  - And he'd hold my hand
  - We were only ten or twelve years old
  - Didn't know about love
  - I found out that it could hurt you so
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I can't help myself
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - Jimmie was the one in high school days
  - We used to drive around the city
  - Thinking we'd grown up
  - Must've been just about sweet sixteen
  - I found a brand new world
  - Brand new love that I had never seen
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I can't help myself
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - No matter how hard I try
  - I just can't leave it alone
  - No use in wonderin' why
  - '''Cause my heart has a mind of its own'
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I can't help myself
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - But I keep on falling
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I can't help myself
  - I keep on falling
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I keep right on falling
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - I can't help myself
  - Can't help myself, falling in love
  - Falling in love

  - Where were you when I was fallin' down
  - Buzzin round your heart
  - Why'd you wait till I was moving on
  - To come out of the dark
  - To say I'm what you need
  - And you could spend your life with me
  - Well I can't help you now
  - (Sorry baby, I can't help you)
  - No, I can't help you now
  - (Keep away, I've fallen in love)
  - Maybe there was a time
  - But sometimes time runs out
  - And I can't help you know
  - Forty days since I stopped countin' the days
  - And countin' the ways that I loved you
  - Good long while since I found
  - Good enough reasons to stop believin' that you
  - Are what I really want
  - And now that you you do baby, I don't
  - Well I can't help you now

  - No, I can't help you now

  - And you could spend your life with me
  - But I can't help you know, no

  - She knows 'cause she can feel it too
  - There's a longing in her heart
  - A longing in her heart
  - Longing in her heart
  - Well now you and me, we're just like them
  - We never wanted to be alone,
  - So we made a pact, sealed with desire
  - For a happier house and home
  - Only to find it doesn't untie
  - The knot where feelings die
  - There's a longing deep inside our hearts
  - And no one to tell us why
  - Our friends aren't looking for anything new
  - They wouldn't know where to look
  - Well her, she likes running the joint
  - And he likes being a cook
  - Together they're doing very well
  - They're might glad they could
  - But there's a fire burning towards them now
  - Coming from a distant wood
  - And even the stars at night agree
  - That the sky is falling apart
  - We know 'cause we can feel it too
  - There's a longing in our hearts

  - They all said Louise was not half bad
  - It was written on the walls and window shades
  - And how she'd act the little girl
  - The deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade
  - Sometimes a bottle of perfume
  - Flowers, and maybe some lace
  - Men brought Louise ten-cent trinkets
  - Their intentions were easily traced
  - Ah, everybody thought it kind of sad
  - When they found Louise in her room
  - They'd all put her down, below their kind
  - Still some cried when she died this afternoon
  - Louise rode home on the mail train
  - Somewhere to the south, I heard them say
  - Too bad it ended so ugly
  - Too bad she had to go that way
  - Ah, but the wind is blowing cold tonight
  - Good night, Louise, good night

  - You dust the bottles on the bar counter

  - Sometimes it's good to lose your pride.
  - These things we do to keep the flame burnin
  - And write our fire in the sky
  - Another day to see the wheel turnin'
  - Another avenue to try.
  - It's in the Luck of the Draw, Baby
  - The Natural Law
  - Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
  - It's in the Luck of the Draw
  - The Natural Law
  - (Flame keep on burnin)
  - Forget those movies you saw, little Baby
  - (Wheel ever turnin').
  - You turn around and say it's last orders

  - Could be the answer to your prayers.

  - But he's front page news, let me tell you why
  - He's on the cover of the New York Post
  - Every network coast to coast
  - All he needed was a hot night in June
  - '''Cause he had the needle and he had the spoon'
  - When he spiked, it bit, and, man, he flew
  - Into America's living room
  - We all love tragedy
  - And it loves us too
  - It's a marriage made in Hollywood
  - Between greed and you
  - 'All you need to be a star '
  - Is to die in open view
  - It's a marriage made in Hollywood
  - Between greed and you
  - Between greed and you
  - Between greed and you
  - Loved by women, admired by men
  - He walked down Broadway with his best friend
  - Brain was wired like a light in a socket
  - With his old friend in his back pocket
  - That horse could kick, that horse could scream
  - Ride you outta here into a different scence
  - Unrequited love and that makes it fair
  - But who keeps score when you're in midair
  - We all love tragedy
  - It loves us too
  - It's a marriage made in Hollywood

  - 'All you need to be a star '
  - Is to die in open view
  - It's a marriage made in Hollywood
  - Between greed and you
  - Between greed and you
  - Between greed and you
  - Like a freefall 'chute that didn't open
  - He looked down to see his dream was broken
  - Stared back up at a hot gray sky
  - Ran his life and then he died
  - Well, if you jump off a building, brother, beware
  - '''Cause my friend Jimmy woke up midair'
  - No time to smile, no time to wave
  - They buried him in a media grave
  - We all love tragedy
  - It loves us too
  - It's a marriage made in Hollywood
  - Between greed and you
  - All you need to be a star
  - Is to die in open view

  - Broken heart, bloodshot stare
  - Signs of a fool who cared too much
  - Now she's gone and he can't remember how
  - To live without her touch
  - Hopin' to die but surely livin' to tell
  - When it comes to matters of the heart
  - There is nothing a fool won't get used to
  - So he found someone afraid his heart would follow the heat
  - He could hardly do more than pretend
  - Though she knew in her heart that his love was alive
  - When it comes to matters of the heart
  - There is nothing a fool won't get used to
  - Now of all the things love teaches
  - All the ways that it opens our eyes
  - None more profound than the lesson he learned
  - The day she walked out of his life
  - Well when the road gets too narrow
  - It's then he remembers her smile
  - And he sees these words forming on her lips
  - Across a river of tears he once cried
  - When it comes to matters of the heart
  - There is nothing a fool won't get used to

  - And it's up to us to reinvent the game
  - Love it when you call my name and

  - Sad smile his apology
  - Sad eyes reaching to the door
  - Daylight loses to another evening
  - Still he spares me words goodbye
  - Sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
  - Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry
  - Suddenly it's so hard to find
  - The sound of the words to speak his troubled mind
  - So I'm offering ease to him as if to be kind
  - There's a train every day
  - Leading either way
  - There's a world you know
  - There's a way to go
  - I soon believe it's just as well
  - This is my opening farewell
  - A child's drawings left there on the table
  - And a woman's silk is lying on the floor
  - I would keep them here if I were able
  - To lock you safe behind it's open door
  - Suddenly it's so clear to me
  - That I'd ask you to see what you may never see
  - Now my kind words find their way back to me
  - There's a train every day
  - Leading either way
  - There's world you know
  - Got a way to go

  - But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay,
  - Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon.
  - He left me with a Keno card, livin' in Vegas ain't too hard,
  - I ran it up to about 50 grand, counted it out and held it in my hand,
  - That kinda word will get around, and make a lost love come up found,
  - I hear ya knockin' baby at my door, but you don't live here no more,
  - Oh no, I think he made his move too soon.
  - I've been from Spain to Tokyo, from Africa to Ohio,

  - Don't want to be down where I last behaved
  - I broke his heart now I can't patch it
  - This time it's grave.
  - I kept track of all the love that I gave him
  - And on paper, well, it looked pretty good
  - He left a note that said he couldn't stay here
  - As if I could...
  - I guess my love's got no business, no business calling
  - His name
  - I guess my love's got no business, no business to blame.
  - One of these days I thought we'd get it together
  - After all that boy was made for me
  - But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers
  - Little bird got free.
  - He always said my love was one sided
  - I tried to keep up with supply and demand
  - But there was one way that pie was divided
  - It was a big piece plan.
  - I guess my love's got no business, no business calling
  - His name
  - I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.
  - Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby getting illegal
  - I got the law doggies on my trail
  - The hawk's out and I could use and eagle
  - To go my bail.
  - You say you're itching baby, so go ahead and scratch it
  - But if its jumps off, don't look at me
  - You swore to God that I couldn't catch it
  - But your dog's got fleas.
  - I guess my love's got no business, no business calling
  - His name
  - I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.

  - Well I went and gave away my TV

  - I put an ad in the paper, baby,
  - Gonna sell everything I own
  - Done everything in the world I know

  - There's just no getting over you
  - Well I went and bought myself a new straw hat
  - One eye pokin' under the brim
  - Bought myself a little seaside shack
  - In case I might just want to swim
  - Done everything I know in the world I know
  - To try to shake these blues but
  - There's just no getting over you
  - Well I try and try
  - But honey it ain't no use

  - Well I got some transcendental meditation
  - And I'm taking up Japanese

  - She don't need anybody to tell her she's pretty.
  - She's heard it every single day of her life.
  - He's got to wonder what she sees in him
  - When there's so many others standing in line.
  - She gives herself to him, but he's still on the other side.
  - She's alone in this world, She's nobody's girl.
  - She's nobody's girl.
  - She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night,
  - Then she disappears for weeks at a time.
  - Just enough to keep him wanting more
  - But never is he satisfied.
  - And he's left to pick up the pieces, wondering what does he do this for.
  - She's off in her own little world, She's nobody's girl.
  - She's nobody's girl.
  - He said "Before I met her, I didn't love nothin'.'
  - I could take it or leave it, that was okay, but
  - She brings out a want in me
  - For things I didn't even know that I need."
  - She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,
  - With anyone. You know, she wants it all.
  - Still she gets all upset over the least little thing,
  - When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small.
  - And she's a walking contradiction,
  - But I ache for her inside.
  - She's fragile like a string of pearls.
  - She's nobody's girl.
  - She's fragile like a string of pearls.
  - She's nobody's girl.
  - She's nobody's girl.
  - She's nobody's girl.

  - I couldn't stop my heart from turning
  - Churnin out my love for you, my love to you.
  - True love or perfection
  - It seems like it's overdue
  - Then just when you least expect it
  - It comes sneakin up on you
  - When I thought that I was dreamin'
  - Felt your body close to mine
  - Now love takes on a different meaning
  - Together till the end of time.
  - I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
  - Feeling that I'd always be the lonely one

  - Seems like such a long time since I held you my arms,
  - And felt you close and warm beside me,
  - Another night is getting late and I'm alone with just the ache
  - And the memory of you beside me.
  - Darling, I've never been so blue,
  - I've tried to see it through,
  - There's nothing I can do.
  - I won't make it on my own,
  - So won't you please hurry home,
  - '''Cause nothing seems to matter without you.'
  - Last time I saw you,
  - There was nothing we could say,
  - We knew it was a time for a change,
  - A time to think you said that night,
  - And I lied and said all right,
  - I left you in the morning,
  - I watched you in the window,
  - And Mexico will never be the same.
  - It was time to be apart,
  - But somehow it seems this heart of mine,
  - Will never find a way to live without you.
  - And now I'm out here on the road
  - And I'm feeling bought and sold,
  - And tonight I just can't but think about you.
  - Darling, I've never been so blue,
  - I've tried to see it through,
  - There's nothing I can do,
  - I won't make it on my own
  - So darling won't you hurry home,
  - Because nothing seems to matter without you.
  - No, nothing seems to matter without you.

  - And it's coiled around our hearts
  - Won't you help me to believe you, baby

  - Tellin' him he's been living a lie
  - Over and over like a line in a song
  - About all the love he let pass him by
  - To her he might be the man of her dreams

  - Broken or battered it really don't matter
  - Her hearts like a wave and he's the tide
  - They're not forever just for today
  - One part be my lover, one part go away
  - He's like a boxer who had to retire
  - After winning but killing a man
  - All of the moves and none of the courage
  - Afraid to throw a punch that might land
  - Not too much later she can't meet his glance
  - You see her start pulling away
  - Over and over like fire and ice
  - One is colored, one is gray
  - They're not forever just for today
  - One part be my lover, one part go away
  - If you know how why don't you say em' a prayer
  - They're gonna need all they help they can get
  - They remember too much about what went wrong
  - It might be they should learn to forget
  - Forget themselves in each other
  - And leave what belongs in the past
  - Carry their hearts like a new born child
  - '''Cause it''s only the moment that lasts.'
  - They're not forever, just day to day.
  - One part be my lover one part go away.
  - One part go away

  - And when they want to have some fun
  - They start to goin' round and round
  - Round and round, up and down
  - Round and round, up and down
  - I got an elevator man
  - In the heart of town
  - And when he's feeling right
  - He will carry you round and round
  - Round and round, up and down
  - Round and round, up and down
  - Baby don't be jealous
  - When I come to town
  - I'm just a country girl
  - Everybody's tryin' to push poor me around
  - Round and round, up and down
  - Round and round, up and down

  - Well it was alright at midnight and you fell out at three
  - So I made you warm and stoked the dying fire
  - When it all came down this morning you were lying next to me
  - How sweet the wine of desire
  - Well we cheated on a friend and cheaters never win
  - Oh the truth I know would be a small relief
  - I could never be the one to say
  - Her best friend took you down
  - Gonna run in the night hide when ever it's light
  - Gonna run in the night like a thief
  - Just ain't no use think it over I was blind but now I see
  - Well she's coming back and I know just what I'll do
  - If it comes right down to you leaving her or staying here with me
  - How sweet the memory of you
  - Well we cheated on a friend and it looks like I lose again
  - I could never be the one to say
  - Her best friend took you down
  - I'd rather run in the night hide when ever it's light
  - Gonna run in the night like a thief
  - Like a thief in the night hide when ever it's light
  - Gonna run in the night like a thief

  - It shakes down to the sea
  - It shakes up to the volcano and then it starts to scream
  - And Lord it makes me tremble

  - When you just give love, and never get love,
  - You'd better let love depart.
  - I know it's so, and still I know,
  - I can't get you out of my heart.
  - You made me leave my happy home.
  - You took my love, and now you've gone,
  - Since I fell for you ...
  - My life has been such misery and pain.
  - I guess I'll never be the same,
  - Since I fell for you ...
  - Well it's too bad, and it's too sad,
  - That I'm in love with you ...
  - When you love me, and then you snub me.
  - But what can I do, I'm still in love with you.
  - I guess I'll never see the light.
  - I get these blues most every night,
  - Since I fell for you ...

  - To make a love work out, I guess

  - But the times when we were happy
  - Were the times we'd never tried
  - Sittin' down by the highway
  - I don't know where I've been
  - I don't know where I'm going
  - Oh God, this is some kind of shape I'm in

  - And I can love you like she can

  - As perfect as a girl can be
  - To love you when your feeling down
  - And miss you when you're not around

  - When it came down on me
  - I said it came down on me-Oh
  - Where'd you say you'd be tonight
  - Streetlights are all I see
  - And now I know the feelin's right
  - '''Cause just last night you came into my dreams'
  - I heard a voice come through on my telephone line
  - Told me that it was your time

  - When will I learn to take you on my journey
  - When will I see that you belong to me
  - When will I learn to take you on my journey
  - When will I see that you belong to me
  - Sweet Forgiveness
  - How could go my way (?)
  - I never really knew how I needed you, but you were right there
  - (I don'tt know the rest)
  - Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me.
  - When you hold me close,
  - 'And you say: "That''s all over."'
  - You don't go looking back,
  - You don't hold the cards to stack.
  - '''Cause you mean what you say.'
  - Sweet forgiveness, you help me see.
  - I'm not near as bad,
  - As I sometimes appear to be.
  - When you hold me close,
  - 'And you say: "That''s all over,'
  - '"And I still love you."'
  - There's no way that I could make up,
  - For those angry words I said.
  - Sometimes it gets to hurting,
  - And the pain goes to my head.
  - Sweet forgiveness, dear God above.
  - I say we all deserve,
  - A taste of this kind of love.
  - Someone who'll hold our hand,
  - 'And whisper: "I understand,'
  - '"And I still love you."'

  - You know I want the same kinda things that you do.
  - You're wasting your time,
  - The way you come to me.
  - Slow down your rhymes and try to reason
  - Can't make things move any faster,
  - By second wishing them to death.
  - You seem to be living on the level.
  - It's decent enough,
  - You got what you wanted.
  - So why do you tell me, that I'm on the wrong track?
  - I'm doin' the best I can do.

  - Gonna tell the truth about it,
  - Honey that's the hardest part.

  - You could even love me, I was all you'd ever need
  - Sometimes when you're sleepin' I wonder if it's true
  - I'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream with you
  - Then you wake and hold me and love me through the night
  - Then I'll know that somehow everything will be alright

  - Thank you, baby, for giving me my life

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt:That_Song_About_The_Midway
  - I met you on a midaway at a fair last year
  - And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
  - You were playing on the horses
  - You were playing on the guitar strings
  - You were playing like the devil wearing wings
  - Wearing wings, you looked so grand, wearing wings
  - Do you tie them to your shoulders just to sing
  - Can you fly? I hear you can! Can you fly?
  - Just like an eagle doin' his hunting from the sky
  - I followed through a sideshow to another town
  - And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
  - You were betting on some lover, shootin' out the dice
  - And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice
  - Once or twice, I heard ya did, once or twice
  - Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
  - Now you've packed it in, I heard you did, packed it in
  - Was it hard to fold a hand you knew you could win?
  - Lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
  - And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
  - The man calls out the numbers... he sometimes mentions mine
  - But I feel like I've been working overtime
  - Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime
  - And I envy you the valley that you've found
  - '''Cause I''m midway down the midway'
  - Slowin' down

  - All the ways I cared for you
  - Are working like you want them to
  - As I break down and you stay strong
  - I write my own forgiveness song
  - I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
  - But it's not your concern
  - Another night and it's only right
  - I toss and I turn in the bed I made
  - The wine dark room the flashing eyes
  - That hung me from my string of lies
  - You said you were numb from wondering
  - I guess I wasn't listening
  - I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
  - But you're not concerned
  - Another night and it's only right
  - That I toss and I turn in the bed I made
  - With my own hands
  - I fashioned this frame
  - And into the wood
  - I carved out my name
  - I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug
  - But you're not concerned
  - Another night and it's only right
  - That I toss and I turn in the bed I made
  - And it's only right
  - That I toss and I turn
  - In the bed I made
  - The bed I made
  - The bed I made

  - If he walks by and the women get engrosed
  - If he winks an eye and the bread slice turns to toast
  - He's got a lot of what they call the most
  - You know the boy can't help it
  - He was born to please
  - And if he's got himself a figure that's just made to squeeze
  - Won't you kindly be aware that the boy can't help it
  - If he mezmerizes each and every one
  - And, Lord when he smiles the beefsteak becomes well done
  - He even makes my grandma feel like she's twentyone
  - You know the boy can't help it
  - He was born to please
  - And if I got to go down to him on bended knees
  - It's because I'm hoping, obviously
  - That some day his answer will be
  - The boy can't help it
  - He's in love with me.

  - Why bother checkin', the facts'll be damned
  - It's how you spin it, it's part of the plan

  - Only so long you can keep this charade

  - The comin' round is going through
  - '''Cause when the money''s makin'' money, it comes down to a few'
  - Got their hands on the throttle and nobody gets through
  - You can work all your life for a hand that will play
  - With one role of the dice, it gets swept away
  - Just look around, things are startin' to slip
  - You're outta control, and you're losin' your grip
  - No way to stop it, that river's spillin' over for good
  - We don't have the answer, we know what it's not
  - '''Cause the people will keep pushin'' ''til they get a shot'
  - Your money's no good there, we wouldn't cash you a check if we could

  - It's hard to say now who left first
  - It used to seem so clear
  - You and I were tangled from the start
  - Somehow the scales just fell away
  - And I'm left standing here
  - Blown open in the hole that was my part
  - I wrap the dark around me
  - There's no solace here tonight
  - There's just wishing and regret for company
  - My glass is raised for all the ways
  - We tried to get it right
  - And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
  - I'm so sorry for the ones we couldn't be
  - Looking through these photographs
  - Searching for a clue
  - How you and I got tangled from the start
  - Not even blood could forge a bond
  - Enough to get us through
  - Or stem the tides that pulled us far apart
  - I'm sorry for the ways I couldn't give you
  - What you needed
  - For all the ways I strung us both along
  - They say it goes both ways and I suppose
  - I could concede it
  - Seems to matter more, now that you're gone
  - And though it seems much kinder
  - Just to leave some things unsaid
  - Like all the ways I tore myself apart
  - If you really want forgiveness, better
  - Try the truth instead
  - It may not be enough, but it's a start
  - I wrap the dark around me
  - There's no solace here tonight
  - There's just wishing and regret for company
  - My glass is raised for all the ways
  - We tried to get it right
  - And I'm sorry for the ones we couldn't be
  - I'm so sorry for the ones
  - Sorry for the ones

  - But I have heard the Prince of Darkness
  - On his charger ride
  - The silver blade is gleamin'
  - The scales are in his hands

  - Each and every day.
  - Sung by a man
  - Named Louie Armstrong.
  - Saint's marched right in from my Close and Play.

  - All the time.
  - Painted by a man
  - Mama said his name was Vinnie.
  - A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day.
  - Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like
  - To help 'em be happy
  - Like that guy named Mike.
  - Yeah that groovy old man that fixes my bike
  - Down there on 'Dumaine Street, New Orleans Louisiana.
  - When I was a kid
  - I had a little wiener dog
  - I loved that little wiener dog
  - And she loved me.
  - Spent warm spring days feeding that little wiener dog
  - Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree.
  - (An') if I ever get older, if I ever die.
  - If I get to a gate at the end of the sky.
  - And a beautiful creature says
  - Now Bonnie what do you want?
  - Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog swear to God.
  - Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want
  - To help 'em be happy
  - Like that ol' gal named Betty.
  - Yeah that groovy old chick teaches Tai-Chi on the levee.
  - Rain or shine she's out there she's dedicated.
  - She wrinkled but she
  - Lovely.
  - She flexible and don't you wish we all were flexible enough to
  - Dance now?
  - Dance little children now
  - The whole round world is your neighborhood.
  - Dance little children now
  - Nekkid as a Jaybird.
  - Dance little children now

  - No covers can hide you tying your shoes
  - My cupboards are overflowing
  - The wine is sublime I'm flyin' too
  - So slide on over and forget it's wrong
  - We're two lights in the nighttime baby

  - The car that I got for me and you
  - So what's comin' on down that road
  - It's two lights in the nighttime baby
  - You know that I'm gonna wanna
  - Share my load with you

  - Maybe I'm a dreamer
  - Maybe just a fool
  - Lately I can hardly see the sun
  - If you had a secret I could take a guess
  - Nothin' in your eyes seems to hold me
  - Truth or consequences
  - Which one will it be
  - Someone said that time would ease the pain
  - Of two lives love has torn apart
  - But, I believe whoever wrote that song,
  - Never had a broken heart
  - One of us is hiding
  - One of us can tell
  - Cause no one likes to be the first to know
  - Someone has to answer
  - Cause someone has to ask
  - Keeping on like this is torture
  - And going undecided is twice as bad for sure
  - Someone said that time would ease the pain
  - Of two lives love has torn apart
  - But, I believe whoever wrote that song
  - Never had a broken heart

  - Warm and lovely mystery, fire smiling through
  - Before this moment fades away I want to know you
  - I've got lightening in my pocket, thunder in my shoe
  - Have no fear I've got something here I want to show you
  - Low, under the falling sky
  - Easily we will lie
  - While I bring it to you
  - It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you
  - And in your eyes the distance left is closing
  - I've got a feeling in my oceans
  - Blood underneath my skin
  - That into your bright fields this prison is opening
  - Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why
  - They hope and try -- live and die
  - So leave them in their frozen world
  - Come and be my lover
  - If only for one stolen moment
  - We will live forever
  - Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?
  - Voices can no longer hold my desire
  - Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire
  - Angels wait to take me higher and higher
  - Higher and higher

  - I was wrong with all my might
  - I took you out in one last round tonight
  - Now there's no more shouting and no more tears
  - Just the fatal words ringing in our ears
  - And in the silence it's crystal clear
  - There's no undoing what has happened here
  - We've come undone, we've come undone
  - Battle waged and nothing won
  - Oh, what have I done? The blood has run
  - Some things can't be undone
  - We hurt the ones we love the most
  - A thousand memories go up in smoke
  - And in the morning when the ashes fall
  - There'll be no need for any words at all
  - We've come undone, we've come undone
  - Battle waged and nothing won
  - Oh, what have I done? The blood has run
  - Some things can't be undone
  - But there's no joy in victory
  - Oh, when it comes at your defeat
  - We've come undone

  - Lately seems like all we ever do.
  - Can't remember when things got so crazy,
  - All I know's I don't know what to do...
  - I guess we oughta stop and think it over.
  - Decide if what we want there's enough of.
  - It's tearing us apart, it cuts right to the heart
  - It's an unintended consequence of love.
  - Remember how we fell into each other, baby
  - Was all we could do to get up out of bed
  - You used to say nobody loved you better
  - I used to hang on every word you said.
  - What happened to those brave and tender lovers?
  - How could we break the mighty promise of?
  - I guess time wore us down, expectations run aground,
  - It's an unintended consequence of love
  - No baby, I'm the one that's takin' chances.
  - I know we've got a love worth fighting for.
  - Let's drop the petty games and pick up dancin'
  - Get back to where we're wanting nothing more
  - I'm calling on you, baby, now or never
  - Let's dig in deep and get out of this rut
  - We'll get back to what brought us both together, baby
  - And find a way to resurrect out strut

  - Lift up your head for me
  - There's somewhere in my heart, only for you
  - Though continents divide, and lonely thoughts collide
  - All heaven will allow, no distance now
  - I can always close my eyes, take your abstance by surprise
  - Hold my breath and make peace

  - As simple as breathing, I picture your face
  - All tangled in daydreams, she'll live in grace
  - There's somewhere in my heart only for you
  - If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out
  - Across this wilderness, from me to you
  - Wherever you may be (Wherever you may be)
  - Lift up your head for me (Lift up your head)
  - There's somewhere in my heart (somewhere in my heart) only for you
  - If I must do without (If I must do without)

  - Paradise
  - I got man who loves me
  - In his life
  - He puts no one else above me
  - It's paradise
  - With everything I ever wanted
  - Paradise
  - It's just like love should be
  - Now you're a thief
  - Everybody I know knows it
  - You're indiscreet
  - Anybody on the street knows
  - That you cheat
  - The damage that you're doin' doesn't
  - Cross your mind
  - Steal the heart just like a thief
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Tell me, tell me, tell me who
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Tell me, tell me
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - You got me
  - Thinkin' I want what you're givin'
  - You got me
  - Wonderin what I'm missin'
  - I can see
  - It's the same old fascination
  - What a deadly game
  - That sends them all right into your flame
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Tell me, tell me, tell me who
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise
  - Tell me, tell me
  - Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise

  - Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself
  - Though I wanted to be brave, it never helped.
  - '''Cause your trouble''s like a flood raging through your veins'
  - No amount of love's enough to end the pain
  - Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong,
  - But the anger that you feel goes on and on.
  - And it's not enough to know that I love you still
  - So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill
  - If you listen you can hear the angel's wings
  - Up above our heads so near they are hovering
  - Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart
  - When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.
  - When it cannot rise above a wounded heart.

  - '''Cause when you''re head tells you to run'
  - But your heart tells you "Girl he's the only one..."
  - You know you have... been in love too long

  - I'd hidden away
  - The pains of the day
  - And the strain of my eyes to see -
  - The grain of my skin
  - At the start of the end
  - Of all I once thought I could be
  - The page has been bent
  - Like an ear, and I've spent
  - Too much just to straighten a line -
  - But you've waited as still
  - As the stone of my will
  - And I know you've changed my mind
  - The beast in this room
  - Paces and moons
  - He's restless and needs to be fed -
  - He moves in for keeps
  - At the first sign of sleep
  - He groans and nuzzles my head
  - I gave nearly all
  - To building the wall
  - That could hide me forever behind -
  - But now even my doubt
  - Seems to know a way out
  - And I know you've changed my mind
  - How little I knew
  - Three that I grew
  - Was not just to root me down -
  - But might stand to wave
  - When the passing of days
  - Begged for a view off the ground
  - My faith had grown cold
  - And all I'd been told
  - Convinced me that just comes with time -
  - But a page has been turned
  - Some old fears unlearned
  - And I know you've changed my mind

  - She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
  - She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
  - We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
  - But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
  - Until the night
  - He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
  - And finally drank away her memory
  - Life is short but this time it was bigger
  - Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
  - We found him with his face down in the pillow
  - With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
  - And when we buried him beneath the willow
  - The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
  - The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
  - For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
  - She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
  - But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
  - Until the night
  - She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
  - And finally drank away his memory
  - Life is short but this time it was bigger
  - Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
  - We found her with her face down in the pillow
  - Clinging to his picture for dear life
  - We laid her next to him beneath the willow
  - While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

  - Down the road here from me there's an old holler tree
  - Where you lay down a dollar or two
  - Go on round the bend come back again
  - There's a jug full of that good ole mountain dew
  - Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
  - I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
  - Now Mr. Roosevelt told 'em just how he felt
  - When he heard that the dry law'd gone through
  - If your liquors too red it'll swell up your head
  - You better stick to that good ole mountain dew
  - Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
  - I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
  - The preacher rode by with his head hasted high
  - Said his wife had been down with the flu
  - He thought that I o'rt to sell him a quart of my good ole mountain dew
  - Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
  - I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
  - Well my uncle Snort he's sawed off and short he measures four feet two
  - But he feels like a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew
  - Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
  - I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew

  - All in the merry month of May
  - When all things they were bloomin'
  - Sweet William came from the Western States
  - And courted Barb'ry Allen
  - It was all in the month of June
  - When the green buds they were fallin'
  - Sweet William on his death-bed lay
  - For the love of Barb'ry Allen
  - He sent his servant to the town
  - Where Barb'ry was a-dwellin'
  - My master is sick and sends for you
  - If your name be Barb'ry Allen
  - So slowly, slowly she got up
  - And slowly she came nigh him
  - 'And all she said when she got there:'
  - Young man, I think you're dying
  - O yes, I'm sick, and very sick
  - And death is on me dwellin'
  - No better, no better I never will be
  - If I can't have Barb'ry Allen
  - O yes, you're sick, and very sick
  - And death is on you dwellin'
  - No better, no better you never will be
  - For you can't have Barb'ry Allen
  - Don't you remember in yonder town
  - When we were at the tavern
  - You gave a health to the ladies all 'round
  - And slighted Barb'ry Allen
  - O yes, I remember in yonder town
  - In yonder town a-drinkin'
  - I gave a health to the ladies all 'round
  - But my heart to Barb'ry Allen
  - As she was on her high way home
  - She spied his corpse a-comin'
  - Lay down, lay down that corpse of clay
  - That I may look upon him
  - The more she looked, the more she mourned
  - Till she fell to the ground a-cryin'
  - Saying - Take me up and carry me home
  - For I am now a-dyin'
  - She was buried in the old church-yard
  - And he was buried nigh her
  - On William's grave there grew a red rose
  - And on Barb'ry's grew a green briar
  - They grew to the top of the old church wall
  - Till they could not grow any higher
  - They lapped and they tied in a true lover's knot
  - And the rose grew round the briar

  - Lor, Lor, my pretty little Pink
  - I'm going to stay away
  - Cheeks as red as a red, red rose
  - Her eyes as a diamond brown

  - Before the sun goes down
  - Fly around my pretty little miss
  - Fly around my daisy
  - Fly around my pretty little miss
  - You almost drive me crazy
  - I reckon you think my pretty little miss
  - That I can't live without you
  - But I'll let you know before I go
  - That I care very little about you
  - It's rings upon my true love's hands
  - Shines so bright like gold
  - Gonna see my pretty little miss
  - Before it rains or snows
  - When I was up in the field of work
  - I sat down and cried
  - Studying about my blue eyed girl
  - Thought to my God I'd die
  - Fly around me pretty little miss
  - Fly around my dandy
  - Fly around my pretty little miss
  - I don't want none of your candy
  - Every time I go that road
  - It looks so dark and cloudy
  - Every time I see that girl
  - I always tell her howdy
  - Coffee grows on white oak trees
  - The river flows with brandy
  - Rocks on the hills all covered with gold
  - And the girls all sweeter than candy
  - Fly around my pretty little miss
  - Fly around my daisy
  - Fly around me pretty little miss
  - You almost drive me crazy
  - I'll put my knapsack on my back
  - My rifle on my shoulder
  - I'll march away to Spartanburg
  - And there I'll be a soldier
  - Charlie is a nice young man
  - Charley is a dandy
  - Every time he goes to town
  - He buys the ladies candy
  - I don't want none of your weazely wheat
  - I don't want none of your barley
  - Want some flour in half an hour
  - To bake a cake for Charlie
  - Every time I go that road
  - It looks so dark and hazy
  - Every time I see that girl
  - She almost drives me crazy
  - I asked that girl to marry me
  - And what did she say?
  - She said that she would marry me
  - Before the break of day

  - Eighth avenue and Broadway
  - Cussin' at the light
  - Wrapped up in my existence
  - My perfect little life
  - When he tapped on my window
  - It scared me half to death
  - And even through the glass I swore
  - I smelled the whiskey on his breath.
  - I turned back and starred straight ahead
  - Wishing I could drive away
  - And just before the light turned green
  - I heard the old man say
  - I'm awful cold and hungry
  - Not a nickel to my name
  - Mister could you spare a little change
  - As I sped away in anger
  - Saw his sadness in the mirror
  - 'It haunted me for miles and miles '
  - Just wouldn't disappear
  - That moment of reflection
  - Pulled my conscience off the shelf
  - And the question crossed my mind
  - Was I looking at myself
  - 'I pulled over on the shoulder '
  - Finally broke down
  - Surrendered to emotion
  - As my knees hit the ground
  - I looked up to heaven
  - And cried in Jesus name
  - Father could you spare a little change
  - 'Could you make me a better man '
  - For my children and my wife
  - Don't let me take for granted
  - All the blessings of my life
  - Please forgive me lord I've lost my way
  - And turned my back on you
  - Perhaps its time I walked a mile
  - In someone else's shoes
  - Much stranger than fiction
  - The truth can open up your eyes
  - Angels walk among us
  - In every shape and size
  - Might be a bum on Broadway
  - That God sends to explain
  - Maybe your the one who needs the change
  - We all could use a little change

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Bradley_Walker:He_Carried_Her_Memory
  - It was all that she left him, the night that she left him
  - So he clung to her memory with all of his might
  - He carried it with him everywhere he went
  - Like a soldier who just couldn't give up the fight
  - He took it to work, and he brought it back home
  - He took it so hard, couldn't leave it alone
  - We all called him crazy in our little town
  - The way that he carried her memory around
  - He boxed it up when he sold their old house
  - It rode right beside him there in the front seat
  - He littered his new place with those same old heartaches
  - It felt right at home there with her memory
  - He took it to church with him three times a week
  - He took it to bed when he laid down to sleep
  - The weight of remembering just wore him down
  - The longer he carried her memory around
  - When she never came back, he gave up on Jesus
  - And he never darkened another church door
  - He took up with whiskey, and he took up with women
  - Till one night he just couldn't take anymore
  - He cried, 'God forgive me, but I've lost my will'
  - As he reached for that cold empty piece of blue steel
  - Then he put another big hole in his heart

  - I never go around mirrors
  - I can't stand to see me without you by my side
  - I never go around mirrors
  - '''Cause I''ve got a heartache to hide'

  - Somewhere just over the rainbow
  - Lie answers to all our dreams
  - But the road we must follow to reach them
  - Is paved with much anguish and grief
  - There's heartache around every corner
  - It lurks like a thief in the night
  - Hiding silently deep in the shadows
  - Making victims of those passing by
  - On this highway of dreams that we travel
  - There's no exit for easy street
  - It's rough and it's rocky and weathered by tears
  - And it's been no exception for me
  - But I know it's the right road I've taken
  - '''Cause it''s lead me somehow to your heart'
  - And I may never have fallen for you
  - If I hadn't reached for the stars
  - In the curves we meet pain and rejection
  - At times it's so hard to be strong
  - But just when I think about turning around
  - You give me strength to go on

  - Right on the money and off by a mile
  - Ahead of my time and way out of style
  - But I'm hangin' tough, I ain't had enough
  - I ain't givin' up on life or love
  - Well I try to stay away from the bottle
  - But I've reached out for the glass
  - I try to pull back on the throttle
  - But I still run out of gas
  - I've been an angel, but never a saint
  - Hung with the devil, don't nobody faint
  - '''Cause I''m hangin'' tough, I ain''t had enough'
  - I ain't givin' up on life or love
  - Yesterday's history, today is a chance
  - Tomorrow is a mystery, so I'm makin' plans
  - To keep hangin' tough, I ain't had enough

  - Oh, I have sailed the bright blue waters,
  - And I have overlooked an ocean full of tears.

  - Well I was born back in '59
  - I didn't come late, I was right on time.
  - We had a '59 ford, that never ran quite right.
  - We'd catch a drive in movie, every Saturday night.
  - Well times were hard for the working man
  - Daddy tried to understand.
  - Everything I love is from '59
  - My first guitar and that girl of mine.
  - Everything I want is from '59
  - I guess I'm behind the times
  - '''Cause everything I love''s from ''59.'
  - Well the prince said hey Grace Kelly
  - Would you be my wife?
  - And Bobby Darin sang MACK THE KNIFE
  - They took Eddie Cochran what could we do?
  - Once he was gone we knew that rock and roll was through.
  - We had technicolor at the scene of the crime
  - Coupe Devilles rolling off of the line.
  - Everything I love is from '59
  - My first guitar and that girl of mine.
  - Everything I want is from '59
  - I guess I'm behind the times
  - '''Cause everything I love''s from ''59.'
  - Everything I love
  - Everything I love
  - Everything I love
  - Everything.
  - Wonder where as time rolls on
  - All that style from 1959 has gone.
  - But I've got memories in the back of my mind.
  - What it was like to be alive in '59.
  - We had technicolor at the scene of the crime,
  - Coupe Devilles rolling off of the line.
  - Everything I love is from '59
  - My first guitar and that girl of mine.
  - Everything I want is from '59
  - I guess I'm behind the times.
  - Everything I love is from '59
  - My first guitar and that girl of mine.
  - '''Cause everything I love,'
  - Everything I love,
  - Everything I love's from '59.
  - '''59. Song by Brian Setzer. Submited by Steve Huggett.'

  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - Went out for a drive
  - He hopped right in that long black car
  - With his baby by his side
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - In a run-down '50 cadillac
  - Jumped out the door
  - Pulled out his forty-four
  - And shot his baby three times in the back
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He ain't afraid to break all the rules
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He never planned on comin' back
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - Never thought he'd use the rod at all
  - Then he said hey daddy-o
  - Put all your money in the bag
  - Or you'll be starin'
  - At your brains on the wall
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - Thought he'd try the man on for size
  - So he took steady aim
  - At that spinnin' red light
  - But he wound up puttin'
  - One right between the eyes
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He ain't afraid to break all the rules
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He never planned on comin' back
  - Now Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - Headed for the Arizona line
  - But word had gotten out
  - On the police radio
  - And he got as far
  - As Hollywood and Vine
  - Johhny, Johnny Kool
  - Shot it out with California's best
  - But in the end he laid there dead
  - In a pool of crimson red
  - Now someone else
  - Would put him to the test
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He ain't afraid to break all the rules
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He never planned on comin' back
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He ain't afraid to break all the rules
  - Johnny, Johnny Kool
  - He never planned on comin' back

  - With my only suitcase in my hand

  - Well I reached up on the shelf
  - For my tattered old Samsonite
  - Oh you're waitin' at the station

  - Food's on the table and the coffee's getting cold
  - And I haven't eaten since I don't know when
  - My 8-track's pumpin' out a country song
  - And I'm tearing down the highway again
  - There's a little hideaway
  - Where my baby waits for me
  - In a little cozy booth by the door
  - I looked all around but my baby had gone
  - She just couldn't wait anymore
  - My 8-track's pumpin' out a country song
  - About a girl that's done me wrong
  - My 8-track's playing all your favorite songs
  - So come on honey sing along
  - It's a Tennessee tradition
  - To lose your inhibition
  - So check your attitude by the door
  - And hear this little tune that I wrote this afternoon
  - And I won't bother you anymore
  - My 8-track's pumpin' out a country song
  - About a girl that's done me wrong
  - My 8-track's playing all your favorite songs
  - So come on honey sing along
  - My 8-track's pumpin' out a country song

  - We traveled through this land a thousand years ago
  - We were the first to see the purple skies
  - I wondered round the desert in a mask of gold
  - I left a thousand things for you to find
  - I left my home where your houses stand
  - I left my gold where your highways ran
  - I lived my life on what you call your land
  - I left my soul in the aztec sand
  - The days grow long the nights are getting warmer
  - The rains are few beneath the blazing sun
  - Traveling fathers finding little water
  - The time has come when we must play this world
  - I left my home where your houses stand
  - I left my gold where your highways ran
  - I lived my life on what you call your land
  - I left my soul in the aztec sand
  - Round and round
  - Our lifetime goes
  - Where does it end
  - Someone must know
  - I've got a family now but you wouldn't know them
  - They're beaten down so hard they can hardly stand
  - We used to live so brave so free like an eagle
  - Now they make us live like a crippled man
  - I left my home where your houses stand
  - I left my gold where your highways ran
  - I lived my life on what you call your land
  - I left my soul in the aztec sand

  - I'm gonna take a plane, baby, here I go
  - I'm gonna walk the streets of Tokyo
  - The crowds of people and the neon lights
  - The rock 'n' roll days and the rock 'n' roll nights.
  - There's a discotheque with a flashing sign
  - There's a sexy girl gonna show you good time
  - Come on in, the shows about to begin
  - Come on, come on, come on.
  - I'm on the back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo.
  - I know a little place but it's hard to find
  - Down the road that twists and the street that winds
  - Roppongi Town down the alleyway
  - The wine does flow and the band does play.
  - So come on, come on, let the fun begin
  - It's a night on the town, it's a night of sin
  - I can take you there, come along with me
  - Come on, come on, come on.
  - I'm on the back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo.
  - So come on, come on, let the fun begin

  - Come on, come on, come on.
  - I'm on the back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo
  - Back streets of Tokyo.
  - Well, welcome to the land of the rising sun
  - And the sun don't set till the party's done
  - Just be careful, baby, don't you press your luck
  - The back streets of Tokyo will eat you up.
  - So come on, come on, let the fun begin
  - It's a night on the town, it's a night of sin
  - I can take you there, come along with me
  - Come on, come on, come on.

  - They took the coal from the mountains, ripped the fruit from the soil
  - Pulled the fish from the sea, drained the earth of it's oil
  - Took the Christ out of christmas, pulled the sun from the sky
  - Their daddies told them to never ask why
  - The barbwire fence is gettin' higher and higher
  - We're gettin' ready to fight fire with fire
  - It's gettin' so there ain't a kind word said
  - But we gotta keep movin' on, pushin' on ahead
  - They led a blind man to a cliff, gave a crippled man a kick
  - Took a poor man to the cleaners and a rich man has his pick
  - Gave a three piece man a job, took an old man to a whore
  - Sent a young boy to a place he ain't never been before
  - The barbwire fence is gettin' higher and higher
  - We're gettin' ready to fight fire with fire
  - It's gettin' so there ain't a kind word said
  - But we gotta keep movin' on, pushin' on ahead
  - Well if they force me to reason, if they ask me to doubt
  - I'll fuss then baby and fight 'em baby, ow
  - East wind is blowin' and a full moon is high
  - There's just no purpose, there's no reason why

  - Rockin' my life away
  - Come down and catch me if you can
  - Down at the Blue Cafe
  - Troubles are miles away
  - And I'm coming down babe yes I am
  - Hopped In my car
  - And said "Man alive"
  - There was not a soul movin'
  - On the 405
  - I thought to myself
  - Hey, I need to make a change of plans
  - I got the call-waiting
  - It was just my luck
  - And I tried you back again
  - But you didn't pick up
  - And it left me with a burnin' question
  - In the back of mind
  - Will I make it to the Blue Cafe
  - Rock my life away

  - Down at the Blue Cafe
  - Troubles are miles away
  - Am I am comin' down, baby yes I am

  - On the car up ahead
  - Comin' through the door
  - Man I just wasn't thinkin'
  - I said where is that chick
  - I was with all night drinkin'
  - They said, "Man she's gone

  - Wait and see
  - He's got a new corvette, he says it does a hundred

  - Paycheck
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - All his life, he was the last in line
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - All my life, he was a friend of mine
  - Bobby's face looked pale and thin, as if some ghost had
  - Haunted him
  - When he asked me what was new, I wasn't quite
  - Sure what to say
  - How come everybody's stickin' bloody fingers in my face?
  - I almost cried and said, "They sure don't make cars
  - Like they use to"
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - All his life, he was the losing kind
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - All his life, he never had peace of mind
  - I shook him hard and said, "Listen, man
  - You can't go back in time again"
  - And never 'til the day that I die
  - Did I see tears fall from Bobby's eyes
  - Four or five years had gone by when I read about
  - How Bobby died
  - He crashed his car into a wall, messed up on drugs
  - And alcohol
  - Another brother led astray, well I'lll be damned
  - If I go that way
  - Say a little prayer for him
  - He lived a life you just can't win
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - All his life, he was the last in line
  - Bobby's back, maybe for good this time
  - Bobby's gone, he was a friend of mine

  - To go through life with a chill in your soul
  - And a memory that lives by your side
  - Don't want you no more heard enough one day
  - So take me on down where that rock and roll plays
  - Don't want you to vow how could you lie
  - With all my life I called you daddy
  - On the boulevard of broken dreams
  - I wonder where you are
  - Are you satisfied
  - To go through life with a chill in your soul
  - And a memory that lives by your side
  - Don't want you no more heard enough one day
  - So take me on down where that rock and roll plays
  - Don't want to get lost on a road so long
  - Your legs get tired and you fall to the ground
  - On the boulevard of broken dreams
  - On the boulevard of broken dreams
  - On the boulevard of broken dreams

  - You stepped in and dark turned to light,
  - Well I knew right there you were the breath of life,
  - Just when I'd given up the fight,
  - Well I knew right there you were the breath of life,
  - Just when the morning had lost its bitter bite,
  - Ooh you never think your heart will butterfly,
  - Ballerina don't you dance your life away,
  - Those years meant nothing till this cold December day,
  - You stepped back to say goodnight,
  - Well I knew right there you were the breath of life,
  - We looked up at a blinding light,
  - Well I knew right there you were the breath of life,
  - I never thought I could say those words again,
  - I think you know the ones,
  - I'm sure you know the ones,
  - I've been hiding alone in the night,
  - On and on like a dream that never ends,
  - So come on out,
  - Don't say goodnight,
  - Out of the shadows to the neon light,
  - Meet you down where that dixieland plays,
  - Leave all your troubles, gonna dance 'em away.
  - Drop my hadns by my side,
  - Let the hourse slip away,
  - Don't say nothin', let the music play,
  - Twenty years on down,
  - When the time is right,
  - I'll turn around and know you were the Breath of Life.

  - It's a late cool autumn evening
  - And the sunset melts into night
  - With a v-twin throbbing beneath me
  - And my head's spinning all right
  - Ritchie and me we started as kids
  - In a rock 'n' roll band on the street where we lived
  - It's a long hard ride till the morning
  - As the trees and wind start to sing
  - Chains around your heart that bind
  - Break away and leave them behind
  - Well once there was a time in this rock 'n' roll dream
  - This here town would be rip apart at the seams
  - Now I'm out of money and billy's out of work
  - Eddie's pushin' pencils for the county clerk
  - Everybody's job is getting pushed out of town
  - Life is just knockin' 'em down
  - Boyhood dreams are run into the ground
  - Long dark shadows hang over this town
  - Cast away the chains that bleed
  - Break away and I leave you free
  - Take my hand come leave with me
  - As nighttime fades away
  - We'll ride the hills and desert sand
  - Cross the barren land
  - All the families have all gone
  - Their jobs went before them I'm sure
  - They knocked down the corner barber shop
  - And put up a super triple level parking lot
  - There once was a time you could vote for a man
  - Who wouldn't try and stick a gun in your hands
  - So cut out all your talkin'
  - And make love with me through the night
  - Chains around your heart that bind
  - Break away and leave them behind
  - Just leave them behind
  - Just leave them behind

  - Don't leave me now don't you realize
  - You can't make out of love a sacrifice
  - Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
  - Who pays the cost
  - If the love that is lost goes unredeemed
  - And why should I care
  - If this cross that I bare is destiny
  - My heart was pure my love was strong
  - Forgive me if I've done you wrong

  - Get 'em on the ropes
  - Give 'em all you got
  - I don't care what they do
  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - Give 'em all the dope

  - I don't care what they do
  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - When I came out to California
  - I didn't think I would change
  - I didn't go and fix my nose
  - I didn't change my name
  - The things some people do for cash
  - It's all a crazy game
  - Sometimes I think the more things change
  - The more they stay the same
  - So get 'em on the ropes
  - Give 'em all you got
  - I don't care what they do
  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - Give 'em all the dope

  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - I heard my neighbor stuck
  - To all the Islamic fundamentals
  - But I found out he really delt
  - In cheap Mercedes rentals
  - Their dealing and their whereabouts
  - Are strictly confidential
  - The fact they own my neighborhood
  - Is strictly coincidental
  - So get 'em on the ropes
  - Give 'em all you got
  - I don't care what they do
  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - I'm trying hard to defuse
  - This infernal situation
  - But all that I can figure out
  - Is mass extermination
  - The newspaper says it's my fault
  - So in hell is where I will stay
  - Although I hear the traffic there
  - Is not as bad as in L.A
  - So get 'em on the ropes
  - Give 'em all you got
  - I don't care what they do
  - I don't care if they rot
  - I said hey when they get drunk
  - They fight all night
  - Give 'em all the dope

  - (Incomprehensible) get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Get rhythm, people, when you get the blues
  - Get a rock n' roll, feel it in your bones
  - Tap on your toes and just get gone
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
  - He's got the dirtiest job in town
  - Bendin' low at the people's feet
  - On the windy corner of the dirty street
  - When I asked him while he shined my shoes
  - How'd he keeps from gettin' the blues
  - He grinned and he shook his little head
  - Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
  - '"Get rhythm, get rhythm when you get the blues'
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Get a rock n' roll, feel it in your bones
  - Tap on your toes and just get gone
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues"

  - Get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Get a rock n' roll feel it in your bones
  - Tap on your toes and just get gone
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues"
  - Well, I stopped to listen to the shoeshine boy
  - And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
  - Slapped on the shoe polish, left and right
  - He took a shoeshine rag, and he held it tight
  - He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
  - '"You''re a mighty little boy to be a workin'' that way"'
  - He said, "I like it" with a big wide grin
  - And he kept on poppin' and he said again
  - '"Get rhythm, get rhythm when you get the blues'
  - (Incomprehensible) get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Well, a jumpy rhythm make you feel so fine
  - (Incomprehensible) all the troubles from your worried mind
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues"
  - '"Get rhythm when you get the blues'
  - Get rhythm when you get the blues
  - Get a rock n' roll, feel it in your bones
  - Tap on your toes and get gone

  - With that he cold new England wind
  - Blowin' through my hair
  - As my blood and whisky
  - Run through me as one
  - Didn't anybody hear her silent scream
  - Didn't anybody see his twisted grin
  - All the neighbours wept and cried
  - By her shallow grave
  - And her momma prayed the lord her soul to take
  - And her daddy stood alone he swore revenge
  - And the haunted river flowed with blood again
  - Late one night he crossed
  - The river by himself
  - The waters surged to reach for him through the night
  - And the storm raged on and on
  - On and on and on and on
  - Everybody wondered what ever happened to
  - The old reverend brown who preaches Sunday mess
  - And the sea turned calm and blue
  - By the oceans door
  - And the haunted river flowed with blood no more

  - Malaga where our lips first met,
  - To the beat of the castanet,
  - Now I pray to the skies above,
  - Bring him back, please bring back my love. Ah!
  - Malaga blue seas still echo his last words to me.
  - "Malague\xF1a, though you are everything to me,"
  - "Malague\xF1a, my true love is the sea."
  - Love like ours must learn to play, play a waiting game,
  - And live just for the flame;
  - "Malague\xF1a, there's a fire deep inside of me,"
  - That must burn, die out, so I can be free.
  - If no spark lingers within when the storm is past,
  - I'll be yours, I'll be yours, yours at last.

  - With a peroxide blonde in a hopped up model Ford
  - Yeah.?
  - Well, we drug down Main, just to make a scene
  - I barked my tires when the light turned green
  - I slapped it to the floor, let out on the clutch
  - And what was left on the road, well - it wasn't very much
  - We flew out of town, we were side by side
  - Twin carburetors were open wide
  - Tires were smoke, it started to whine
  - I'm tellin' ya, that blonde, she left me way behind
  - I'm draggin', draggin' down Main once more
  - With the peroxide blonde in a hopped up model Ford
  - Now I'm never-never-never draggin? down Main no more, ooh-ooh?
  - With a peroxide blonde in a hopped up model Ford
  - A peroxide blonde in a hopped up model Ford, ooh-ooh?

  - You got me jumpin' like a cat strung up on a wire
  - Waiting for the sandman to put me to sleep
  - I got a no show take it slow waiting for the whistle blow
  - No where job on a dead end street
  - You ain't got a minute when the siren sounds
  - Gotta get movin' to the underground
  - But I gotta woman gonna love me through the night
  - Slippin' and slidin' and holding me tight
  - Well here it comes again another Saturday night
  - Pour another drink I hope I make it home all right
  - Oh boy oh boy gotta keep headin' for the state line
  - Makin' time gotta meet a friend of mine
  - My old ford runs fine I gotta say
  - Got a new set of plugs I wish the rain would go away
  - A hundred u.f.o.'s by the holiday inn
  - I should really go to sleep but baby here I go again
  - Well take me the hotel no one's there oh well
  - Whatever happened to news on the radio
  - Every little place in this little town
  - Looks like a bomb just leveled to the ground
  - Drivin' through jersey headed for d.c.
  - Look at all the boarded up factories
  - All the kings men have a summerhouse in France
  - But you and me live on the radiation ranch

  - Setzer-Stewart
  - Darling, we've had our problems in the past
  - But now the rain's washed everything away
  - We've been through this
  - Through all the tears and pain
  - I've done so many things that I just can't explain
  - But now the rain washed everything away
  - Just as the sun lights up a cloudy day
  - And I hope you've come on back to stay
  - Cause the rain washed everything away
  - We've come this far
  - Too far to turn back now
  - I said so many times I'd make it work somehow
  - Oh, yes I did
  - But now the rain washed everything away
  - Just as the sun lights up a cloudy day
  - And I just hope you've come on back to stay
  - Cause the rain washed everything away
  - The door's already closed
  - Hold on with all your might
  - Those rainy days are gone
  - The future's clear and bright, oh yes it is hey!
  - But now the rain washed everything away
  - Just as the sun lights up a cloudy day
  - And I know you've come on back to stay
  - Cause the rain washed everything away
  - Oh wash it away

  - I ain't got a care
  - Rather ride around with Rosie in the middle
  - Slip and slidin' and tryin' to keep the rhythm
  - Aha, Rosie in the middle
  - Aha, bam, that does it, when you come around
  - Bring a sister for my cousin
  - I work late on a Saturday night
  - He just drove out from New York City
  - Here he comes again like a mad wild dog
  - Howling at the moon and spitting on the ground
  - I like Rosie in the middle
  - Pretty little gal that I desire

  - Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
  - Mom and Dad cursed the day you were born
  - Throw your clothes into a duffle bag
  - Shoutin' as ya slam the door home is a drag
  - Who can I turn to and where can I stay?
  - I heard a place is open all night and all day
  - There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
  - You can act real wild they don't treat you like a child
  - Runaway boys
  - Your hair's all greasy and you feel like a slob
  - You're only fifteen and you can't get a job
  - Go into the luncheonette and shoot a few games
  - Losing all your quarters, man it's always the same
  - Steal a couple of bucks to buy a new toy
  - Slip into the alley with the
  - Runaway boys
  - Runnin' faster, faster all the time
  - You're under age and God knows, that's a crime!

  - My little Santa Rosa Rita wore high heels on her feet
  - A ring on every finger and a couple on her toes
  - Well she told me where to meet her and then my Santa Rosa Rita
  - Showed me a thing or two I did not know
  - Like how to swing a pretty thing to a rockin' sound
  - Dip her on my hip, let her hair hang down
  - Spin around again and never lose the beat
  - Toss her up and catch her right between my feet
  - Well you really gotta meet her, she's my Santa Rosa Rita
  - My little Santa Rosa Rita sure turns up the heat
  - A little hotter when the music starts to sway
  - And there ain't nobody sweeter than my Santa Rosa Rita
  - To hold and listen to the music play
  - I love to swing a pretty thing to a rockin' sound
  - Dip her on the hip, let her hair hang down
  - Spin around again and never lose the beat
  - Toss her up and catch her right between my feet
  - Well you just can't beat her, she's my Santa Rosa Rita
  - I wish I had not agreed to let my Santa Rosa Rita
  - Share a dance with anyone but me
  - But the gentleman insisted and I had not resisted
  - Now Santa Rosa's just a memory
  - But I can swing a pretty thing to a rockin' sound
  - Dip her on my hip, let her hair hang down
  - Spin around again and never lose the beat
  - Toss her up and catch her right between my feet
  - Well you really gotta meet her, she's my Santa Rosa Rita
  - Well I guess I can't keep her, she's my Santa Rosa Rita

  - He would take a dip in the Mississippi
  - He would dive from the centre and swim to the dam
  - When the time had come and he took the plunge
  - 'Everyone screamed: "My God, what has he done"'
  - And though he tried to swim, the current carried him
  - Closer and closer to the brink of the falls
  - The people lined the banks of the Mississippi

  - They're three guys that I like the most
  - Everybody say a prayer each day
  - That oughta keep the devil away
  - Father son and the holy ghost
  - They're three guys that I like the most
  - Everybody say a prayer each day
  - A word for Jesus lights the way

  - Cochran-Fairchild
  - Uh well I got a girl with a record machine
  - When it comes to rocking, she's a queen
  - I took her to a dance on a Saturday night
  - All alone where I can hold her tight
  - She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
  - The elevator's broken down.
  - So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
  - Five six seven flight, eight flight more
  - Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
  - Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag
  - I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.
  - Well she called me up on the telephone
  - 'Said : ''Come on ever baby ''cause I''m all alone'''
  - 'I said : ''Baby you''re mighty sweet'''
  - '''But I''m in bed with aching feet'''
  - This went on for a couple of days
  - But I couldn't stay away.
  - Oh I walk one, two flight, three flight four
  - Five six seven flight, eight flight more
  - Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
  - Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag
  - I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock
  - You know I'm too tired babe.
  - Well I sent to Chicago for repairs
  - Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
  - I hope they hurry before it's too late
  - You know I love my baby too much to wait
  - All this climbing is getting me down
  - They'll find me come straight over the rail.
  - And I walk one, two flight, three flight four
  - Five six seven flight, eight flight more
  - Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
  - Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag
  - I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock, ooh.
  - Well I got a gal with a record machine
  - When it comes to rocking, you know she's a queen
  - I took her to a dance on a Saturday night
  - All alone where I can hold her tight
  - She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
  - The elevator's broken down.
  - Well I walk one, two flight, three flight four

  - Tornados spin me around the rain beats on my face
  - Hurricanes ain't nothing baby a tidal wave can't quench my thirst
  - Don't you think that we all know your good looking pulled you through
  - I'm just sittin' here waitin' for Desiree
  - Drink of wine from a lovin' cup your face looks all messed up
  - I don't want to see you clear I like your picture hard to read
  - I know I should get out, but my mind's already made up
  - I'm just sittin' here waitin' for Desiree
  - I'm waitin' for Desiree
  - The news is bad enough but it's the only station I can get
  - I turned the TV off but you ain't come on yet
  - You lead a sheltered life
  - At least that's what I think
  - Anytime that I get up
  - Fix myself a drink
  - Your voice come on right now
  - And damn I missed you again
  - I'm just sittin' here waitin' for Desiree
  - I'm just sittin' here waitin' for Desiree
  - I'm just sittin' here waitin' for Desiree

  - We've come to steal your daughters
  - We like our booze and our rock 'n' roll
  - We'll break your heart and we'll steal your soul
  - We don't buy that two-bit rap
  - '''Cause American Idol is a bunch too crap'
  - I didn't buy this here guitar
  - To be a big television star
  - We are the Marauders
  - It's nothing no one taught us
  - If you're a Pennsylvania man
  - They'll stick a shovel right in your hand
  - We've got this music in our soul
  - It's nothing you can hear on the radio
  - If you don't get it, it's your tough luck
  - We don't care about makin' a buck
  - We're the boys and we're here to rock
  - We are the Marauders
  - We'll never obey your orders
  - Right now they think you're a fool
  - Next year they'll be following you
  - Don't buy the official line
  - That they don't like this song of mine
  - If you don't like it, the door ain't locked
  - Buy me one more Rollin' Rock
  - I said buy me one more Rollin' Rock
  - Come on, buy me one more Rollin' Rock
  - We are the Marauders
  - Life is one tall order
  - You gotta do what you wanna do
  - You gotta do what you're born to do
  - But this whole life is way to short
  - If it feels right to you

  - Setzer
  - Well, it ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
  - Every once in a while, maybe just a week or two
  - Well, I don't got nothing to worry about
  - The kids take off and momma screams and shouts
  - It ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
  - Every once in a while, not very often
  - Well, they say a man has to work from sun to sun
  - But a woman's work it ain't never ever done
  - If I work my knuckles right down to the bone
  - You better have that supper at the table at home
  - It ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
  - When Hepcat gets the blues
  - There's nothing nobody can do
  - The wind starts blowin' and the sky gets cloudy and gray
  - Ain't nothing nobody can say
  - Get on your hands and knees and pray
  - It ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
  - Here we go
  - Go ahead Cat
  - When Hepcat gets the blues
  - There's nothing nobody can do
  - The wind starts blowin' and the sky gets cloudy and gray
  - Ain't nothing nobody can say
  - Get on your hands and knees and pray
  - It ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
  - You better just hope that I don't come lookin' for you
  - '''Cause I just don''t know exactly what I''m bound to do'
  - I'm gonna drink Jack Daniel's right off the floor
  - Get a quart of beer and baby holler for more
  - No, it ain't everyday that Hepcat gets...
  - It ain't everyday that Hepcat gets...
  - Ain't everyday that Hepcat gets the blues

  - I used to search for the ideal girl
  - The perfect little prettyness
  - I used to search for the ideal world
  - But frankly think it don't exist
  - So many times I get so afraid
  - So many ways I felt so betrayed
  - We get together on a Saturday night
  - And watch the whole world cave in
  - Little girl I wanna know
  - What you look for in a man
  - Is he tall, tough and handsome
  - With a continental teint
  - I just wanna be around
  - When the big world hits the ground
  - I don't wanna make a sound
  - When the sky comes tumblin'
  - Sky comes tumblin' down
  - I used to worry about the job that I had
  - I barely made enough to survive
  - Oh man I'm worried about the life that I live
  - Sometimes I barely made it home alive
  - But now I don't need to worry
  - There's no need to rush there's no need to hurry
  - You don't need a new job you don't need a new wife
  - You don't need to go far in your life
  - Little girl I wanna know
  - What you look for in a man
  - Does he have a lot of money
  - Even more than you can spend
  - I just wanna be around
  - When the big world hits the ground
  - I don't wanna make a sound
  - When the sky comes tumblin'
  - Sky comes tumblin' down
  - I used to play in a dead end band
  - I always ended up on my own
  - But now I play in a skeleton band
  - Nothing but skin and bones
  - Oh no I don't need sedation
  - I got my daily dose of radiation
  - We get together on a Saturday night
  - And watch each other's hair fall out
  - Little girl I wanna know
  - What you look for in a man
  - Does he sell a lot of records
  - With his Californian band
  - I just wanna be around
  - When the big world hits the ground
  - I don't wanna make a sound
  - When the sky comes tumblin'

  - It's missin' all the chrome
  - It must be plain to see
  - Baby who would really love this car but me?
  - Man I picked a lemon
  - A lemon from the tree
  - That grows in every junkyard
  - From here to Tennessee
  - I know it's gonna start
  - I just can't find the key
  - So why the hell is everybody starin' at me?
  - It's just a '55 Caddy
  - The brakes are no good
  - It won't leave you stranded
  - In a bad neighborhood
  - The lights don't even work

  - Tomorrow's dawn
  - And find soon enough
  - That her man is gone

  - Let me fly let me fly away
  - Spring is comin'
  - And the ice will break
  - And I can't linger
  - For a woman's sake
  - She'll see a shadow
  - Pass overhead
  - And she'll find
  - A ring beside her bed
  - Well my heart knows what
  - The wild wind knows
  - And I must go where the wild wind blows

  - Well I'm changing all my strings
  - I'm gonna write another traveling song
  - About all the billion highways and the cities at the break of dawn
  - Well I guess the best that I can do now is pretend that I've done nothing wrong
  - And dream about a train that's gonna take me back where I belong
  - Well now, the ocean speaks and spits and I can hear it from the interstate
  - I'm screaming at my brother on a cell phone he's far away
  - I'm saying nothing in the past or future ever will feel like today
  - Until we're parking in an alley
  - Just hoping that our shit is safe
  - So I go back and forth forever
  - All my thoughts they come in pairs
  - Oh I will, I won't, I doubt, I don't
  - I'm not surprised but I never feel quite prepared
  - Now I'm hunched over a typewriter
  - I guess you call that painting in a cave
  - And there's a word I can't remember
  - And a feeling I cannot escape
  - And now my ashtrays overflowing
  - I'm still staring at a clean white page
  - Oh and morning's at my window
  - And she is sending me to bed again
  - Well I dream the dark on the horizon
  - I dream a desert where the dead lay down
  - I dream a prostituted child touching an old man in a fast food crown
  - Oh yeah, I dreamt a ship was sinking
  - There was people screaming all around
  - And I awoke to my alarm clock
  - It was a pop song, it was playing loud
  - So I will find my fears and face them
  - Or I'll cower like a dog
  - I'll kick and scream or kneel and bleed
  - I'll fight like hell to hide that I'm giving up

  - Swallowed the only key to save me
  - Lost my Will

  - Had to show my hearts
  - Got no magic sleeve
  - Where to hide my aces?
  - I shot the moon and luck betrayed me
  - But you won't hear me cry tonight
  - Down below, I'm out of your sight
  - Fair weather, friends
  - On the trail we ride
  - Can't buy your love
  - Can't afford your time
  - Bury me in the Deadwood pines
  - By Black Hills gold and my true love's side
  - Now he's dead and gone like my tallest tales
  - And no one believes that he was my baby
  - Locked up to this leaden weight
  - Empty bottle to seal my fate
  - Calamity Jane
  - I'm the queen of spades, and
  - For my last words, I sing your praises
  - But you won't hear me cry tonight
  - Down below, I'm out of your sight

  - The other night, I had a dream in blue
  - Counting stars for every time I lose you
  - Calling out to the lonesome moon, and
  - Waitin' on a white flower to bloom
  - Float along the river's lazy bend
  - See the willows standin' hand in hand, they
  - Sing about my lovesick blues, and
  - Drown me in their mournful music
  - The other night, you had a dream in red
  - Lost your sleep to the noise of the unsaid
  - Strange sounds from the open window
  - Wander out to the ghost who knew you
  - Lay me down upon the stones I threw
  - Close my eyes so they can't accuse you
  - Make believe that you didn't do it
  - Innocent until they can prove it
  - Tell your alibi until it's true
  - Swallow all the pleasures of your choosin'
  - Hear the barn owl wondering "who"
  - He's there to watch your every move
  - The other night, I had a dream in blue
  - Countin' stars for every time I lose you
  - Callin' out to the lonesome moon, and

  - Reachin' up for the sky when
  - Grabbed my hand in a dream
  - And woke before I could say

  - To the fountain filled with snow
  - Mumblin' "I'm sorry"

  - Of some other lady
  - Whose song doesn't sound
  - Like mine
  - Sorrow in the shadow of his freedom
  - He'd see heartache if he ever looked behind

  - Hiding snakes in green grass on the other side
  - Where the painting hangs

  - When the roof falls in the sky begins to pour
  - And all the ground erodes away with rushing water
  - The tide comes in and swallows up the shore
  - 'All the land disappears '
  - We walk no longer
  - We walk no longer
  - And we float upon the a broken ocean
  - Where nothing ripples in its wake
  - Tho' nothing stays in motion
  - Broken ocean breaks
  - When the lesson's learned and written on a page
  - I'll buy the book to watch it burn and save the ashes
  - 'For soon arrives an age '
  - A loss of innocence when we get judged in every way
  - That stop the splashes
  - Stop the splashes
  - We float upon the a broken ocean
  - Where nothing ripples in its wake
  - But nothing stays in motion
  - '''Til the broken ocean breaks'
  - And we float upon a broken ocean

  - Pull up the ropes tight and we'll swing above this place
  - Get high for a while and watch the moon melt
  - From this roof-top seat We can dance above the town
  - On the soles of our feet and curse the ground
  - We'll pretend to be hung upon apostrophes
  - That pluralize the empty eyes
  - And judge a man by his degree
  - It's so nice up here
  - And the air feels good to breathe
  - My vision's clear
  - But it's getting harder to see
  - Harder to see

  - Meet me by the river when the sun's going down
  - Make a little fire pass a bottle 'round
  - Ain't no path so follow all the sounds
  - Oh I'll see you down there
  - You could tell two friends and they could five
  - We'll all be here when Jack and Jim arrive
  - It's been just us and the trees And a little fresh air
  - And when the whiskey's all gone and the night grows old
  - There's no more sense in the stories told
  - We can laugh down the path with smoke in our clothes
  - And find a little peace down there
  - So maybe I'll see you down there
  - We'll all get together for a while
  - 'So maybe I''ll see you down there '
  - Everyone together for a while
  - Oh, I'll see you there
  - Oh, I'll see you there
  - Meet me in the city where the street's run down
  - Gather up a crowd in an empty town
  - It's where people speed up and time slows down
  - Oh, I'll see you down there
  - Sally pours a drink and the glasses raise high
  - We wrote on the wall in a crooked line
  - The same song plays that we heard so many times
  - And now we'll hear it down there
  - So maybe I'll see you down there

  - Cold enemies look like warmer friends
  - If they don't, let's pretend
  - Hey, we've got some rules to bend
  - We all reach a point when we find a way
  - To sink into a place We think the same
  - But then
  - Find a loose end and a reason to blame
  - What can't contain
  - And the war carries on
  - Look out, look out, man
  - When the cold's rolling in
  - You look out and see wreckage
  - Let the warm day begin
  - No, no
  - In automatic battle it feels cinematic
  - So dramatic That eventually you're numb, too
  - All the others that see another point of view
  - Not like you
  - You're not like them
  - Hey we've all got some rules to bend
  - Look out, look out man
  - When the cold's rolling in
  - Look out and see the wreckage
  - Let the warm day begin
  - No, no
  - No, no, no
  - It's all coming down to the line in the sand
  - Where the people gather 'round and decide where to stand
  - If the winds came in and blew away the lines
  - Just a bunch of people standing with nothing to divide
  - It sounds so easy but really there is no chance for
  - Breaking up the lines that decide what we stand for
  - So for now let's find a little common ground
  - And make a warm day in a cold war
  - Look out, look out man,
  - When the cold's rolling in
  - Look out and see the wreckage
  - Let the warm day begin
  - Look out, look out man,

  - (Uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
  - Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
  - A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
  - And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll

  - And he found a mercy-seat inside the whale
  - Over there, over there
  - In that land so bright and fair
  - We'll tell him about it over there
  - In that hallelujah land
  - I'll take Jonah by the hand
  - And we'll tell him all about it over there
  - In the cold and briny deep
  - Tears of grief did Jonah weep
  - And the big fish threw him out upon the shore
  - Then he quickly went his way
  - Preached to Ninevah night and day
  - For he did not care to backslide anymore
  - Now some people don't believe
  - That a whale could him receive
  - But still that does not prove my song untrue
  - There are whales on every side
  - With their big mouths open wide
  - Take care my friend that one don't swallow you
  - Over there, over there
  - In that land so bright and fair
  - We'll tell him about it over there
  - In that hallelujah land
  - I'll take Jonah by the hand
  - And we'll tell him all about it over there
  - Many souls are tossed about
  - By the whales of fear and doubt
  - But the Saviour wants to take them by the hand
  - If you will his voice obey
  - He will save you right away
  - And lead you over to the promised land
  - Over there, over there
  - In that land so bright and fair
  - We'll tell him about it over there
  - In that hallelujah land
  - I'll take Jonah by the hand
  - And we'll tell him all about it over there

  - Make people scream for you
  - We love to hear you
  - You've got your big swing face
  - You know the night away out in space
  - Looks like a beautiful, beautiful place
  - You've got your big swing face
  - "You\u2032re in the arena"
  - You bow to the crowd
  - But you gotta looka down
  - Some people laughing
  - It's easy to laugh
  - "When your zipper\u2032s down"
  - "Fly\u2032s open"
  - I know you're the great being
  - You're so hilarious
  - You're leaving us in the dust
  - Your big swing face
  - Your rolling eyes away out in space
  - Looks like a beautiful, beautiful place
  - You've got your big swing fa-ya-ya-ya-yace
  - In your costume foolery
  - Beads, sandals and jewelry
  - You're a funny guy
  - We'll never wonder why
  - You've got your big swing face
  - You've got your lonely night away out in space
  - Looks like a beautiful, beautiful place
  - You've got your big swing fa-ya-ya-ya-yace

  - Movin' to the high ground, to the sugar mine
  - Movin' to the secret so clandestine
  - World of fantasy wish you could come

  - Mama keep telling me not to come
  - Used to be a mouse, now I can roar
  - Tomorrow I'll give myself a little bit more
  - Forget about tomorrow live for today
  - No guarantee I'll make it anyway
  - My special candy tastes good now
  - Every day I die a little, a little anyhow

  - Take me to the mountain
  - Fly closer to the sun

  - Oh don't the sun look lonesome tonight
  - Shining down through the trees
  - I'm feeling like such a mannish child
  - Bottlenecking while I'm eating gummy fleas
  - I'm watching cartoons and eating little candy
  - And everybody here wants to be like me
  - Walking on the sidewalk with W.C. Handy
  - And all the little wannabees turn to see
  - I'm getting up, time to dust my broom
  - Sing nursery rhymes of pain
  - I'm trading cards with John the Conqueroo
  - We're setting up our toy mystery trains
  - I'm watching cartoons and eating little candy
  - And everybody here wants to be like me
  - Walking on the sidewalk with W.C. Handy
  - And all the little wannabees turn to see
  - I'm eating chocolate chip cookie dough
  - Heading down the crossroads
  - Walking with my jelly beans
  - Sitting at the master's knee
  - (All aboard! All aboard!)
  - I'm watching cartoons and eating little candy
  - And everybody here wants to be like me

  - Like a frightened child in the cold light, so frail
  - Things were going so well, just rolling along
  - Now, just when you think you got it all made,
  - You think it's all gone
  - China Doll, I've got something for you
  - A few good words, a hand to help you get through
  - May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
  - Lay down your weary head
  - Do whatever you gotta do
  - Put on your strong face when they're in the room
  - Can't show signs of weakness; an unspoken rule
  - Put on your strong face, act like nothing's wrong
  - We can be so helpless, helpless and so strong
  - China Doll, I've got something for you
  - A few good words, a hand to help you get through
  - May not be much, but now it's all that I can do
  - To ease your worried mind
  - Do something to get through
  - We bend and break, so fragile, it's true
  - I say everything'll be all right, but I don't have a clue
  - They say faith is a crutch, well, whatever works for you
  - In a world where you never know
  - I'll be there for you,
  - I'll be there for you ...
  - China Doll, I've got something for you
  - A few good words, a hand to help you get through

  - We were new to love when we were young
  - Lying in our arms, gravity unwinding
  - Not knowing we were too young to love
  - And the years passed by in our entwining
  - And the eastern coast met the western shore
  - And the masses of land fit just like a glove
  - And the dawn that came up, moved us to explore
  - The borders that outlined our love
  - Continents drift
  - Across a moonlit ocean
  - Continents divide
  - In a glacial measured motion
  - Continents drift
  - As foothills move our mountains
  - Our fault lines are accounted
  - As our continents divide
  - We're old hands at love, no longer young
  - Lying here alone, invisibly unwinding
  - Believing we needed to be young to love
  - And the years pass by in our unbinding
  - And the world presses in and our shorelines change
  - And the cycle of tides moves us in the darkness
  - Now the light that comes up on your distant range
  - From the east casts a shadow between us

  - Deep down in the south county,
  - Over where the paper mill runs,
  - Lived a man, a young country doctor
  - With the perfect wife and sons.
  - Well, he worked his days,
  - And on Sundays he'd pray,
  - And nobody knew
  - Why the wife slowly withered away.
  - I saw the country doctor
  - To ask him what was wrong with me.
  - 'He was caught unaware, accidental and devil-may-care:'
  - Behind the curtain, I see two shadows in front of me.
  - Whoa, nobody knows the trouble I've seen.
  - My guess, there was another woman,
  - And with the kids and the money, was a lot to lose.
  - He said she had an rare affliction
  - And he was doing all he could do.
  - And we all believed him,
  - Felt so sorry, and then -
  - I thought once he was a fine man -
  - Now, I don't remember when.
  - Well, I saw the country doctor
  - To ask him what was wrong with me.
  - 'He was caught unaware, accidental and devil-may-care:'
  - Behind the curtain, I see bottles unmarked in front of me.
  - Whoa, nobody knows the trouble I've seen.
  - 'I saw the country doctor '
  - In a place where he didn't see me,
  - Way out in the middle of the night
  - Where he thought no one could see.
  - Over there in the parlor room,
  - Making eyes, hands roaming free.
  - Someone soon must know the trouble I've seen.
  - Did you think about the young ones?
  - One day they'll know it was you.
  - And if they let you off one day,
  - Who, then, will you turn to?
  - And my wife remembers one thing,
  - She said, "I remember kind of strangely,
  - At a friend's wedding one time,
  - It was a look that he gave me."

  - She came from the backwoods
  - Bright teeth, stylish hair
  - Good fortune and everyone's smiles
  - Followed her everywhere
  - Had a taste for the good life
  - Had some stars in her eyes
  - Thought she would have it all
  - Once her name was in lights
  - Hey, hey little Miss Jane
  - Sunny day turned to hard rain
  - Traded in your evening gown
  - For a jumpsuit of pain
  - The beauty queen and the wallflower
  - Feel the same in their darkest hours
  - All watch as the crown of jewels
  - Falls from the old guard tower
  - She walked down the runway
  - A crown of jewels she wore
  - Applause and lights, but at the end of the night
  - She was the first out the door
  - Drove all night at high speed
  - Arrived in the early day light
  - Flash of a knife, a nice evening dress
  - Couldn't change her man's mind
  - Hey, hey little Miss Jane
  - Sunny day turned to hard rain
  - Traded in your evening gown
  - For a jumpsuit of pain
  - The beauty queen and the wallflower
  - Feel the same in their darkest hours
  - All watch as the crown of jewels
  - Falls from the old guard tower
  - Stage moms and hair-sprayed charms
  - No one there could have sounded an alarm
  - I don't know why you think it's so strange
  - Any kind of act is within anyone's range
  - Hey, hey little Miss Jane
  - Sunny day turned to hard rain
  - Traded in your evening gown
  - For a jumpsuit of pain
  - The beauty queen and the wallflower
  - Feel the same in their darkest hours
  - All watch as the crown of jewels
  - Falls from the old guard tower

  - It's been a long time coming
  - This feeling I've got
  - Things'll always go your way
  - Such a long shot
  - Been so deep in the hole
  - Thought I'd never crawl out
  - Anything can happen, whoa
  - I know that now
  - One slip, one fall
  - A turn of the head can change it all
  - A step ahead, a step behind
  - A blink of an eye at the wrong time
  - North, south, east and west
  - Spin the wheel and hope for the best
  - No regrets and it's on we roll
  - Put it in drive and set the cruise control
  - Walk tall and away you go
  - Wheels roll and the whistle will blow
  - Many miles, oh, I may roam
  - Put it in drive and set the cruise control
  - He was holding on, he trusted me
  - Then he slipped away
  - 'He fell hard and now '
  - I've just got myself to blame
  - When he smiled at me
  - Finally, oh, I came around
  - 'You can''t worry, you never know '

  - Put it in drive and set the cruise control
  - In my darkest hour, my longest day
  - Oh, my mind was a prison
  - I could feel it taking me down to stay
  - Then I said, "Forget this
  - It's out of your hands anyway"

  - Spin the wheel and hope for the best
  - Many miles, oh, I may roam

  - Most of our years have flown away with nothing much decided
  - Except the board we're playing on, how it's to be divided
  - Will more years yet die alone, the question's many-sided
  - Got no answers of my own and none have been provided
  - When I was young there was nothing to know
  - And the wind followed me wherever I'd go
  - Rain came down where I made my stand
  - And the cyclone rose with a wave of my hand
  - And the cyclone rose with a wave of my hand
  - There is a game that's only played in a darkened room with strangers
  - Dealt down and dirty with unmarked cards, eyes closed to dangers
  - Jealousy folds without playing its hold card, romance raises grinning
  - I spent several lifetimes there when I could not lose for winning
  - When I was young there was love for free
  - Glad to be given and received by me
  - Rain came down where I made my stand
  - And the cyclone rose with a wave of my hand
  - With a wave of my hand
  - I believe I can still make the cyclone rise
  - Just can't see it so well with my fading eyes
  - A mystery to myself, not everything now I was born to be
  - All I know is when I wanted it, so the wind itself rose for me
  - You know if it wasn't for love I might just be a wandering man
  - But I believe I've made the better choice to sing about it with this band
  - When I was a boy I could summon the moon
  - With a crook of the finger and a homemade tune
  - I could ride the clouds when they sailed on by
  - And sing all the words to a wildcat's cry
  - When I was young there was nothing to know
  - And the wind followed me wherever I'd go
  - Rain came down where I made my stand
  - And the cyclone rose with a wave of my hand
  - And the cyclone rose with a wave of my hand
  - I believe I can still make the cyclone rise
  - And the cyclone rose, wave of my hand
  - Rain came down where I made my stand

  - And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
  - Didn't have a care in the world
  - With mother and daddy standin' by
  - But "happily ever after" fails
  - And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
  - The lawyer dwell on small details
  - 'Since daddy had to fly '
  - But I know a place where we can go
  - That's still untouched by men
  - We could sit and watch the clouds roll by
  - And the tall grass wave in the wind
  - You can lay your head back on the ground
  - And let your hair fall all around me
  - 'Offer up your best defense '
  - But this is the end
  - 'This is the end of the innocence '
  - O'beautiful, for spacious skies
  - But now those skies are threatening
  - They're beating plowshares into swords
  - For this tired old man that's no longer king
  - Armchair warriors often fail
  - And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
  - The lawyers dwell on small details
  - 'Since daddy had to fly. '
  - Bt I know a place where we can go
  - And was a away this sin
  - We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
  - And the tall grass wave in the wind
  - Just lay your head back on the ground
  - And let your hair spill all around me
  - Offer up your best defense
  - But this is the end
  - 'This is the end of the innocence '
  - Who knows how long this will last
  - Now we've come so far, so fast
  - But, somewhere back there in the dust
  - That same small town in each of us
  - I need to remember this
  - So baby give me just one kiss
  - Come and take a long last look
  - 'Before we say goodbye '
  - Just lay your head back on the ground
  - And let your hair fall all around me
  - Offer up your best defense
  - But this is the end
  - This is the end of the innocence

  - I'm certain I will grab you and lift you
  - As you hold on tight and sway
  - We'll go walking
  - Across the fields of gray
  - When I was younger I saw things in black and white
  - Now all I see is a sad, hazy gray
  - Sometimes I see a narrow flash of light
  - Sometimes I look and you show me the way
  - No matter what else happens
  - Or what the future will be
  - In a world so uncertain
  - Through the clouds it's hard to see
  - I will grab you and carry you
  - Calm your fears if you're afraid
  - We'll go walking
  - Across the fields of gray
  - We'll go walking, walking, walking
  - On the fields of gray
  - We'll go walking...
  - Lights turned way down low
  - Music soft and slow
  - With someone you love so
  - Hey, that's where it's at
  - Your heart beating fast
  - Thinking that it's not gonna last
  - Hoping that it won't last
  - Hey, that's where it's at
  - That's where it's at, pretty baby
  - That's where it's at
  - That's where it's at, pretty baby
  - That's where it's at
  - That's where it's at
  - Your whole world turned upside down
  - You're making not a sound
  - With no one else around
  - That's where it's at
  - And your heart beating fast
  - Thinking that it's not gonna last
  - That's where it's at
  - That's where it's at, pretty baby
  - That's where it's at
  - That's where it's at, pretty baby
  - That's where it's at
  - That's where it's at
  - We'll go walking, walking, walking, walking, walking
  - On the fields of gray
  - In a world so uncertain
  - Walking, walking, walking, walking, walking
  - On the fields of gray
  - Sad scenes and bad dreams
  - Walking, walking, walking, walking, walking
  - 'On the fields of gray '
  - On the fields of gray

  - I'm sitting wondering, watching the parade
  - In my ever-present chair
  - People laughing and smiles all around me
  - Balloons and paper in my hair
  - There's a man in a car with the top down
  - Waving wildly at me
  - The poor son of a gun, I know he's thinking
  - Better him, him than me
  - I've stared down the devil, and had to look away
  - Called out to the angels, but no-one ever came
  - Laid down odd and even, but double zero played
  - That's alright, I'm a lucky one
  - Such a fortunate son
  - I was always taught well, taught well
  - To be the strong one and keep it inside
  - But sometimes I sit beside the freeway
  - And howl out at the dark, dark sky
  - I might just have to go out and burn one
  - Have a drink or a few
  - Fade away in a cloudy haze of smoke
  - And give the old man's best salute
  - I've stared down the devil, and had to look away
  - Called out to the angels, but no-one ever came
  - Laid down odd and even, but double zero played
  - That's alright, I'm a lucky one
  - Such a fortunate son
  - I might just have to go out and burn one
  - Have a drink or a few

  - Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
  - When I was a child I caught a fever
  - My hands felt just like two balloons
  - Now I've got that feeling once again
  - I can't explain, you would not understand
  - This is not how I am
  - I have become comfortably numb.
  - Ok, ok, ok
  - Just a little pinprick.
  - There'll be no more ah!
  - You may feel a little sick.
  - Can you stand up? Stand up?
  - I do believe it's working, good.

  - Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
  - When I was a child
  - I caught a fleeting glimpse, fleeting glimpse
  - Out of the corner of my eye.
  - I turned to look but it was gone
  - I cannot put my finger on it now
  - The child is grown,
  - Dream is gone.
  - Oh, I have become comfortably numb.

  - Jenny drove out to Vegas for the first time
  - Picked up a guy hitching on the highway side
  - Rode into town together looking for a sign
  - Thought they saw something in the keno lights
  - She'd always do what she should
  - Nice girl of the neighborhood
  - Had everything that money could buy
  - Went out for a ride, looking for the
  - Funhouse, dark as night
  - Strap in for the long ride
  - Funhouse, don't be frightened
  - Who knows what you'll find
  - Jimmy was fascinated with the made men
  - Went out to find any movie he could rent
  - Died his hair black, bought him an olive oil suit
  - To run with the hoods, like Romulus in Reno would
  - I know you play by the rules
  - But I know you've got a dark streak too
  - Go out for a closer view
  - Go out for a ride, looking for the
  - Funhouse, dark as night
  - Strap in for the long ride
  - Funhouse, don't be frightened
  - Who knows, you might like it
  - She loved how she felt that tingle in her body
  - When she had her palm read in the back of the house
  - She loved how everybody loved her when she took it out
  - Would jump around, would scream and shout
  - Forbidden fruit sure tastes fine
  - Better than towing the long, straight line
  - Careful what you ask for you might just find
  - You like it when you cross the line, looking for the
  - Funhouse, dark as night
  - Strap in for the long ride
  - Funhouse, don't be frightened
  - Who knows what you'll find
  - Funhouse, dark as night
  - Strap in for the long ride
  - Funhouse, danger's high
  - Who knows, what you might find
  - Funhouse, dark as night
  - Strap in for the long ride
  - Funhouse, dno't be frightened
  - Who knows, you might like it

  - Hide in the bayou under the gun
  - Been to the house of the rising sun
  - Come down here trying to make a connection
  - Must have a bad sense of direction
  - Go back, go back to your woods
  - (Go back, go back, go back to your woods)
  - Go back, go back, go back to your woods

  - One-eyed jacks and king with the axe
  - Come from the wrong side of the tracks
  - Go back, go back to your woods
  - (Go back, go back, go back to your woods)
  - Go back, go back, go back to your woods
  - (Go back, go back to your woods)
  - When the night goes down on Storyville
  - If the women don't get you, the music will
  - Catch a thrill
  - You come down here in a four piece suit
  - Pork pie hat and the alligator boots
  - Keep jerking rabbits outta your hat
  - Now can you pull a disappearing act
  - Go back, go back to your woods
  - (Go back, go back, go back to your woods)
  - Go back, go back, go back to your woods

  - Gonna be some changes made
  - Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be some
  - Man was a knife expert
  - Kind of a Jim Bowie type
  - Swaggerin', blusterin', 'coon skin
  - I said, "You're not serious, right?"
  - Then I saw him grab my friend by the hair
  - And I guess I should have prayed
  - As he dragged him around, I said to myself
  - '"There''s gonna be some changes made"'
  - (Gonna be some changes made)
  - 'Girl I knew and loved alone '
  - For years from afar
  - 'With a finger to her lips '
  - She led me out to see the stars
  - 'She led me down to the gritty lake '
  - And in it we did wade
  - 'She took my hand and put it there '
  - Gonna be some changes made
  - (Gonna be)
  - Gonna be some changes made
  - Gonna be some changes made
  - (Gonna be some changes made)
  - Gonna be some changes, changes made
  - Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
  - Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
  - Gotta take it off, gotta get myself straight
  - Gonna be some changes, some changes made
  - Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
  - Better figure out something
  - Things are looking grave
  - Gonna be some changes, changes, changes made
  - Up in front for all to see
  - Graceful like a bumblin' fool
  - Then I thought I felt slip from my mouth a little drool
  - 'Maybe no one noticed it '
  - On my mind heavily it weighed
  - I saw two people snickering
  - I said, "There needs to be some changes made"
  - (Snickering)
  - Gonna be some, gonna be some changes made
  - (Snickerin')
  - (Gonna be)
  - Gonna be some changes made

  - Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days
  - Look in the mirror I see a clown's face
  - Some changes made
  - 'Going home, I''ve done enough '
  - To sow my little name
  - 'Going where the fields are green '
  - "And I can do my macram\xE9"
  - A buffoon fumblin' without a clue
  - Who likes to shift the blame
  - And often feels betrayed
  - There's gonna be some changes made
  - There's gonna be some changes made
  - Gonna be some changes, changes made
  - Can't keep on doing what I've been doing these days

  - You're thinking I'm just
  - Another one telling lies
  - Don't want to be fooled

  - And I always go mine
  - Maybe one day we'll come together
  - Go across the great divide
  - I heard somebody
  - Calling you a bad name
  - I was speechless
  - Didn't say anything to him
  - Next time I swear
  - It's gonna be different
  - I promise not to be silent again
  - And you always go your way
  - And I always go mine
  - Maybe one day we'll come together
  - Go across the great divide
  - And I always cross to the other side
  - But I go back every time
  - Maybe one day we'll come together
  - Go across the great divide
  - I saw a bombed aisle
  - Heard a gunshot ring
  - Saw two matchsticks burn
  - Felt the bedsheets sting
  - Ugly words on a wall
  - And a robe in flames
  - I saw a little boy smile

  - Bright light streaming in, through my window pane
  - Think I'll stare at the shapes it makes
  - On the floor and then stare again
  - You've got your curtains drawn,
  - Anything I can do?
  - Maybe a rose or a pillow or a picture or a funny joke just for you
  - To carry you away
  - Let me bring you, some tokens of esteem
  - Close the door on the world, make it our own beautiful scene
  - There's a darkness visible, maybe only to me
  - Maybe just a dream, a time-slowing-down dream,
  - A hole you're sinking down deep
  - Comes loose at the seams, make the dream leave
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those convicting may be the guilitiest of all
  - Wash it all away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray,
  - Some halcyon days
  - Feel a strong gravitational pull, holding you down
  - And the air feels thick, having a hard time
  - Moving through, moving round
  - I'm hoping you may let me, help to pull you through
  - You're here so you might as well let me see
  - If I can do that for you
  - Carry you away
  - Feeling so helpless, mostly I'm a clown
  - Every now and then gotten so even
  - Up can feel like down
  - In the hour of my reflection, I've had enough of disaffection
  - Like a starless sky, no light in our eyes
  - Maybe change this tonight, some brighter times, some lovely rhymes
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those in judgment could be guiltiest of all
  - Wash it away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray,
  - Some halcyon days
  - Maybe just a dream, some ever-present dream, evanescent scenes
  - It could seem so for me, this is for me
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those in judgment could be guiltiest of all
  - Wash it away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray,

  - Take some hours and waste them away
  - Let your mind flow freely
  - Take some time and forget about time

  - We had our own
  - Closed off universe
  - Closed time like curves
  - Fly east around the world
  - And here we are again
  - The air between us bends
  - Seven times around the world
  - In a single second I will swirl
  - I move through to find you
  - As a vibrating string
  - Balls colliding
  - Slower time elapsing
  - Here we are again
  - Here younger now than then
  - Many holes in space I rend
  - Dark matters' presence binds and mends
  - You stand unseen
  - Only the seen to me
  - Across the unknown
  - As time fades to shadows
  - Wildly moving radiation
  - Planets swirling like creation
  - Time for us to cut through space
  - Past the speed of light we race
  - All that's happened in the past erased
  - And here we are again

  - Don't light a match, don't play with fire

  - There's a shelter down at the veteran's hall
  - Living in the shadow of the hot house ball
  - We can dance in the streets any night or day
  - The big ball men built such a nice old park
  - One day we'll celebrate every halloween
  - Our faces as masks everyone glow in the dark
  - Don't light a match, don't play with fire
  - Step real lightly round the barb wire
  - Keep the noise down to hear the meltdown call
  - Living in the shadow of the hot house ball
  - Temper's hot, better pray for rain
  - Better watch out now for the gamma rays
  - Party time at the government gate

  - Got mayflies in May, June bugs in June
  - Mosquitoes all summer long and by July you're through
  - August is beautiful for copperheads and their friends
  - And ticks will embrace you all until September's end
  - Hey, we're having a ball in the low country
  - We're having a ball in the low country
  - Yes, we're having a ball, no problems at all
  - Not hitting a wall, having nice fun with you all
  - Having a ball in the low country
  - We hunt our beautiful wildlife in our blaze orange hats
  - They make us look real funny but it's the law, got to respect that
  - Stand still for the turkey, stay loose for the squirrel
  - Lots of specialized skills you need in our corner of the world
  - Hey, we're having a ball in the low country
  - We're having a ball in the low country
  - Yeah, we're having a ball, no problems at all
  - Not hitting a wall, having nice fun with you all
  - Having a ball in the low country
  - In the low, in the low, in the low country
  - October, November sets us up for Christmas time in the flats
  - More time to watch our furry friends, hunt 'em, kill 'em, put 'em on a mat
  - January means New Year's, time to get a buzz on
  - February, March and April, more time for choosing sun
  - Hey, we're having a ball in the low country
  - We're having a ball in the low country
  - Yeah, we're having a ball, no problems at all
  - Not hitting a wall, having nice fun with you all
  - Having a ball in the low country
  - We love our Bobby Labonte and the WWF
  - We love our Swaggart and Haggard and we love the W, the president
  - There's love all around us, our church friends are doing well
  - And the little mongoloid children we'll keep 'em all from hell
  - Hey, we're having a ball in the low country
  - We're having a ball in the low country
  - Yeah, we're having a ball
  - Not hitting a wall, not hummer stone
  - No problems at all, we're not hitting a wall
  - Having nice fun with you all in the low country

  - What do you do?
  - Where do you go?
  - What do you say?
  - And how do you know?
  - I'll say who cares
  - When people stare
  - I will make myself invisible
  - Yes I will, yes I will
  - When I feel like a freak
  - When I'm on the other end of someone's mean streak
  - People make fun, I've got to lose myself
  - Take my thin skin and move it somewhere else
  - I'm setting myself up for the future
  - Looking for the chance that something good might lie ahead
  - I'm just looking for the possibilities
  - And in my mind I've got this skin I can shed
  - What do you do?
  - Where do you go?
  - What do you say?
  - And how do you know?
  - I'll say who cares
  - When people stare
  - I will make myself invisible
  - Yes I will, yes I will
  - I walk down the hallway, ducking
  - Barbs flying, people crying and I'll be lying on the floor
  - Get the feeling ain't doing nothing but sucking
  - Knock, knock on my head becomes a loud, loud roar
  - What do you do?
  - Where do you go?
  - What do you say?
  - And how do you know?
  - I'll say who cares
  - When people stare
  - I will make myself invisible
  - Yes I will, yes I will
  - It's fun, fun
  - And what do you do?
  - Where do you go?
  - What do you say?
  - And how do you know?
  - I'll say who cares
  - When people stare
  - I will make myself invisible

  - We can share the women
  - We can share the wine
  - We can share what we got of yours
  - '''Cause we done shared all of mine'
  - Keep on rolling
  - Just a mile to go
  - Keep on rolling, my old buddy
  - You're moving much too slow
  - I just jumped the watchman
  - Right outside the fence
  - Took his rings, four bucks in change
  - Ain't that Heaven sent?
  - Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon
  - Burns my eyes to see
  - Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon
  - Might as well be me
  - We used to play for silver
  - Now we play for life
  - And one's for sport and one's for blood
  - At the point of a knife
  - And now the die is shaken
  - Now the die must fall
  - There ain't a winner in the game
  - He don't go home with all
  - Not with all
  - Leaving Texas
  - Fourth day of July
  - Sun so hot, the clouds so low
  - The eagles filled the sky
  - Catch the Detroit Lightning
  - Out of Sante Fe
  - The Great Northern out of Cheyenne
  - From sea to shining sea
  - Gotta go to Tulsa
  - First train we can ride
  - Gotta settle one old score
  - One small point of pride
  - There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon
  - Will keep him from the sun
  - Ain't a bed can give us rest now
  - You keep us on the run
  - Jack Straw from Wichita
  - Cut his buddy down
  - And dug for him a shallow grave
  - And laid his body down
  - Half a mile from Tucson
  - By the morning light
  - One man gone and another to go, my old buddy
  - You're moving much too slow
  - We can share the women
  - We can share the wine

  - I met a fan dancer down in Southside Birmingham
  - She was running from a fat man selling salvation in his hand
  - She said he's trying to save me
  - But I'm doing all right, the best that I can
  - Just a pair of fallen angels trying to get through the night
  - Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
  - Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder
  - Coming over the airwaves, the man says I'm overdue
  - Sing a song, send some money, join the chosen few
  - Mister, I'm not in a hurry, and I don't want to be like you
  - All I want from tomorrow is to get it better than today
  - Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
  - Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder
  - All I want from tomorrow is to get it better than today
  - Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
  - Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder

  - Oh, I'm leaning on a rail
  - Letting my eyes roam over the plain
  - Oh, I'm laughing on my break
  - Feeling like a captive on a long chain
  - Watch the people pick up sticks
  - Big boss man cracks his whip
  - It's serious but we laugh to keep from crying (whoa, crying)
  - Spouting out the company line
  - Everything here's just fine
  - He says he cares about me but he's lying (whoa, lying)
  - And up, up in the big house
  - The king of the hill
  - Oh, I'm watching the boss man
  - Talking to his sister with the dirty hands
  - They sit, cussing at the rules
  - Wishing they could lose me as fast as they can
  - He's got me in the roughest rig
  - He thinks I took his brother's gig
  - People say they've got the game rigged (whoa, rigged)
  - His daddy gave him everything
  - A job and a house and his earring
  - Why does he think that I'm so threatening, (whoa, so bad)
  - And up, up in the big house
  - King of the hill
  - And there, driving the big cat
  - King of the hill
  - I'm over in my space
  - Swatting bugs, sweat stains rolling down my face
  - I'm trying not to drink
  - Knowing I've got to roll out of this place
  - Watch the people pick up bricks
  - King of the hill with his nightstick
  - Caught up in accounting tricks
  - Throw a bone to the poor hicks
  - Got some candy, take a lick
  - Great white hope, shooting bricks
  - Time to let us all share the wealth (whoa, the wealth)
  - Getting coffee for the big stick
  - Hand in his pants at the skin flick
  - Leisure suit, but thinks he's slick
  - Lots of poisons, take your pick
  - Mama, mama, mama come quick
  - Feeling like I'm getting sick
  - Have you noticed any nervous tics
  - Think I'd better take care of myself (whoa, myself)
  - And up, up in the big house
  - King of the hill
  - And there, driving the big cat
  - King of the hill

  - Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
  - That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done
  - While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
  - Till things we've never seen will seem familiar
  - Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
  - Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
  - Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
  - Who came through many fights, but lost at love
  - While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks
  - Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
  - Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
  - She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den
  - Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell
  - I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
  - The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
  - Strategy was his strength, and not disaster
  - The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
  - That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
  - The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice
  - His job is to shed light, and not to master
  - Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
  - In hopes he will return, but he cannot be bought or sold

  - Celexa and Cymbalta keep my feet on solid ground
  - Drugs, the road to nowhere, seems that's never in dispute

  - Or just stay quiet every time
  - While you talkin' your line
  - Keep everything fine, whoa, fine
  - Between us, I can see
  - Things are not what they used to be
  - My old friend changed
  - Or maybe it was me
  - Things get so complicated
  - Jokes made, friendships dissipated
  - Long silence but I speak
  - Now so belated
  - I say, hey, wait a minute
  - What's that you said?
  - Not so sure that I heard you right
  - Whoa, oh, hey, wait a minute
  - Oh, say that again
  - You're in the dust
  - Drawing a long straight line
  - We'd be playing outside
  - We'd swing on the swings
  - Shared most everything
  - Sit there and even sing
  - Now I sit and wonder
  - Why it's a friendship charade
  - Looking for fights all day
  - I don't want to play, whoa
  - But I do, here we go
  - I fire off another lame remark
  - You're in the dark
  - No bite, just your bark
  - But it leaves a painful mark
  - Oh, painful mark on your soul
  - Takes its toll
  - I might as well fold
  - I've got my courage up
  - Gonna roll low
  - I say, hey, wait a minute
  - What's that you said?
  - I'm not so sure that
  - I heard you right
  - Whoa, oh, wait a minute
  - Say that again
  - You're in the dust
  - Drawing a long straight line
  - We talk and talk
  - But you never see
  - Unreconstructed defiantly
  - My old friend changed
  - Or maybe it was me
  - Things get so complicated
  - Jokes made, friendships dissipated
  - I've stayed quiet
  - So we don't get alienated
  - I say, hey, wait a minute

  - I heard you right
  - Whoa, oh, hey, wait a minute
  - Oh, say that again

  - You know it's a funny phenomenon
  - People on their constant run
  - So obvious to me and yet

  - You might hear what you're looking for
  - Hearing nothing but the sound of your mind
  - Listen to the silence
  - A little quiet time
  - You just might find what you're after
  - If you close your eyes, hmmm
  - There's a jackhammer here, a speechmaker there
  - Here a gun, there a gun, everywhere
  - See my man go tearing his hair
  - When everything's fine
  - I don't pretend to know a lot
  - I'll do the best with what I've got
  - Clear my head and give it a shot
  - Till the stars line up right
  - Listen to the silence
  - You might hear what you're looking for
  - Hearing nothing but the sound of your mind
  - Listen to the silence
  - A little quiet time
  - You just might find what you're after
  - If you close your eyes
  - This isn't deep, it's not profound
  - It;s just something that I think about now
  - Had to find a new way around
  - The old way's not right
  - Self-help books and the latest moves
  - Who knows what will get you through
  - Don't know about me, less about you
  - I don't know but I'll try
  - Listen to the silence
  - You might hear what you're looking for
  - Hearing nothing but the sound of your mind
  - Listen to the silence
  - A little quiet time
  - You just might find what you're after
  - If you free your mind
  - It's a noisy life I'm living right now
  - Believe I've done my time in the loud

  - And the white-wheeled limousine's standing alone
  - She didn't want to think that she lived a lie

  - No one else in sight
  - I'm so sure I just won't last much longer
  - Lost in the snow didn't know where to go
  - Don't know how to cook or how to sew
  - Maybe I'll make friends with the deer, who knows
  - They have problems too with this snow
  - In the dimming light
  - On frozen ground I lay so helpless
  - No one else in sight
  - I'm so sure I just won't last much longer
  - Got separaated don't know how
  - They went straight and I went around
  - Thought we'd meet up by that ravine
  - I'm hoping this is where I was last seen
  - In the dimming light
  - On frozen ground I lay so helpless
  - No one else in sight
  - I'm so scared I just won't last much longer
  - Slogging through the snow waist deep
  - Digging, reaching, looking for me
  - Give your own a strong love

  - Row the boat of love, lost soul

  - We all tried to ease the pain
  - Took him in when he needed some shelter
  - Tried to make him feel he was one of us again
  - There was one day, oh, I can remember
  - He sat alone with a pencil in his hand
  - All day long he drew careful on the paper
  - In the end, just a picture of a man
  - There's the lost soul coming down the road

  - We'll row the boat to the far shore

  - The day we went walking downtown
  - As I recall, it was in early December
  - After school had just let out
  - When I see you on the street in the twilight

  - Get a load of him, he's so insane
  - You better get your coat dear
  - It looks like rain
  - We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
  - The In-laws hope they'll see you very soon
  - But is it in your conscience that you're after
  - Another glimpse of the madman across the water
  - I can see very well
  - There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
  - And I can see it very well
  - There's a joke and I know it very well
  - It's one of those that I told you long ago
  - Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
  - The ground's a long way down but I need more
  - Is the nightmare black
  - Or are the windows painted
  - Will they come again next week
  - Can my mind really take it

  - The song came and went
  - Like the times that we spent
  - Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
  - I laughed and she'd smile
  - It would last for awhile
  - You don't know what you've got
  - Till you lose it all again
  - Listen to the mandolin rain
  - Listen to the music on the lake
  - Oh, listen to my heart break
  - Every time she runs away
  - Listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears as they roll
  - Roll down my face as she turns to go
  - A cool evening dance
  - Listenin' to the bluegrass band
  - Takes the chill from the air
  - Until they play the last song
  - The bluegrass band
  - Listen to the bluegrass band
  - I'll do my time
  - Keeping you off my mind
  - But there's moments that I find
  - I'm not feeling so strong
  - Listen to the mandolin rain
  - Listen to the music on the lake
  - Listen to my heart break
  - Every time she runs away
  - Listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears as they roll
  - As she turns to go
  - Down my face as she turns to go
  - Runnin' down by the lakeshore
  - She did love the sound of a summer storm
  - Played on the lake like a mandolin
  - Now it's washing her away
  - Washing her away once, once again
  - The boat's steaming in
  - I watch the sidewheel spin
  - And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
  - I can't change my mind
  - I knew all the time that she'd go
  - But that's a choice I made long ago
  - Listen to the mandolin rain
  - Listen to the music on the lake
  - Listen to my heart break
  - Every time she runs away
  - Listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears roll as they roll
  - Roll down my face as she turns to go
  - As she turns to go
  - Down my face as she turns to go
  - Listen to the tears roll down my face
  - As she turns, as she turns to go
  - As she turns to go, as she turns to go
  - As she turns to go
  - That would be something
  - Listen to the rain
  - Listen to the mandolin rain

  - When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
  - And the hot sun chills me to the bone
  - When I can't hear the song for the singer
  - And I can't tell my pillow from a stone
  - I will walk alone by the black muddy river
  - And sing me a song of my own
  - I will walk alone by the black muddy river
  - And sing me a song of my own
  - When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
  - And the stars start to splatter in the sky
  - When the moon hits the southwest horizon
  - With the scream of an eagle on the fly
  - I will walk alone by the black muddy river
  - And listen to the ripples as they moan
  - I will walk alone by the black muddy river
  - And sing me a song of my own
  - Black muddy river, roll on forever
  - I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side
  - Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll
  - When it seems like the night will last forever
  - And there's nothing left to do but count the years
  - When the strings of my heart begin to sever
  - And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears
  - I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
  - And dream me a dream of my own
  - I will walk alone, by the black muddy river
  - And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own

  - Remember those cartoons we watched when we were younger
  - Opposing angels sat there on Bugs' and Daffys' shoulders
  - And baffled and confused them with their clever banter
  - Now the gods a young boy saw there reappeared when he was older
  - And driving I have Michael on the seat beside me
  - Chiding me and tempting me with aggressive reckless speed
  - Tailgating, speeding, running yellow lights
  - Saint Michael is the angel who inspires us to fight
  - The Cherubim, The Seraphim
  - Saint Michael, please don't tease me
  - A gospel hymn for life and limb
  - Archangel, please release me
  - And lucky I have Raphael sent down to Earth to save me
  - Calming me and soothing me with heaven's healing grace
  - Courtesy and kindness, letting others in
  - Saint Raphael's the angel who doesn't need to win
  - The Cherubim, The Seraphim
  - Saint Raphael, please guide me
  - A gospel hymn for life and limb
  - Archangel, stay beside me
  - The Cherubim, The Seraphim

  - Will you take this ride with me
  - Maybe I'll be a doctor, ophthalmologist checking out eyes
  - Maybe I'll get a job making little skinny curly fries
  - I might feel important as a security guard

  - Let's all keep our voices low, here's a story you don't know
  - As good as anything we can't watch on HBO
  - Before you say it's all bunk or throw it out as so much junk
  - Listen what this guy's been hiding in his trunk
  - He's looking for me, he's looking for you
  - He'll cut off your feet just to take your shoes
  - There was that little girl, pink ribbon, auburn curls
  - Who ended up as cargo and then taken for a whirl
  - He must've given her a whack, pre-teen surprise attack
  - She ended up between the guys' spare tire and his jack
  - He's looking for me, he's looking for you
  - He'll cut off your feet just to take your shoes
  - He's looking for me, he's looking for you
  - Believe you me, every word is true
  - In his kitchen there's a corpse, made a meal of his divorce
  - Eats a different body part for every different course
  - In his basement there's a crypt, it's so well, well equipped
  - He's seen so many ghoulish things they now seem nondescript
  - He's looking for me, he's looking for you
  - Another peep and we'll be through
  - He's looking for me, he's looking for you
  - He'll cut off your feet just to take your shoes

  - Train rolls by about 3 a.m.
  - Wakes me from a fitful sleep
  - Got the urge to jump on board
  - I believe I'm in a little too deep
  - Walk the train station
  - Walking through the park
  - Looking out for something
  - Still in the dark
  - One day you'll see something
  - Oh, with a familiar ring
  - It'll be just me moving through
  - On the way to something
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - It's your world, and I'm just passing through
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - Your life, and I'm just passing through
  - Tired and confused, yes I am
  - Don't see much in the future for me
  - I'm a vagabond and a drifter
  - Not so hard to be
  - Walking down the highway
  - Walking through the park
  - Looking out for something
  - Still in the dark
  - Don't know what to say when I see you smile
  - So I guess I'll turn my head and go
  - On the way to another mile
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - It's your world, and I'm just passing through
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - Your life, and I'm just passing through
  - Walking down the highway
  - Walking through the park
  - Looking out for something
  - Still in the dark
  - Want faith in something
  - So hard to believe
  - Maybe one night soon
  - Maybe you could make me see
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - It's your world, and I'm just passing through
  - It's your life, it's your world
  - Your life, and I'm just passing through

  - Hey now, where are you going
  - Where are you going to, my friend
  - Said I'm going out to find
  - The pastures of plenty
  - I believe they're out there somewhere
  - Did you hear about the girl
  - Alone in the world
  - Thought she was losing her mind
  - She found it in the discarded refuse pile
  - Down near the railroad line
  - A book of sonnets, torn and tattered
  - A few remained intact
  - One held the key, she said to me
  - To getting some feeling back
  - Sometimes my head turns round and round
  - Sometimes you talk but I can't hear a sound
  - Sometimes I look down, find my feet off the ground
  - I feel that I'm somewhere else bound
  - Hey now, where are you going
  - Where are you going to, my friend
  - Said I'm going out to find
  - The pastures of plenty
  - I believe they're out there somewhere
  - She looked down the railroad track
  - Lined with trees on each side
  - She prayed for the strength to run to the boxcar
  - To pull herself up for the ride
  - You invite me to your house - you're so sincere
  - We sit so close for a while
  - You reach out for me in the low light so clear
  - But you look like you're frowning when you smile
  - Hanging around just to see what could happen
  - Hanging on by, oh, the thinnest thread
  - Sometimes I see the faintest glimpse
  - Sometimes I feel I'd be better off in bed
  - Hey now, where are you going
  - Where are you going to, my friend
  - Said I'm going out to find
  - The pastures of plenty
  - I believe they're out there somewhere

  - But he kicked the blues for awhile
  - Manny wanted to be artsy
  - Always dressed in black
  - Our spirits rose as he struck the pose
  - But he found peace in the wonderful clothes
  - Hey, oh, hey, now there you go
  - Round and round and round it goes
  - Where it stops no one knows
  - Hey, oh, whoa, oh, there you go
  - Round and round and round it goes
  - First to laugh is the last to know
  - Jimmy went and joined the gym
  - His posing was a sight
  - We thought he looked like a clown in tights
  - But we were the ones home alone at night
  - And hey, oh, hey, now there you go
  - Round and round and round it goes
  - Where it stops no one knows
  - Hey, oh, whoa, oh, there you go
  - Round and round and round it goes
  - First to laugh is the last to know
  - Johnson loved to feign indifference
  - A nihilist to the brim

  - Poppin' up, poppin' down
  - Burrowing, making their funny little sounds
  - Guarding the ground and rooting all around
  - Watch your dry bones in the prairie dog town
  - Teddy Roosevelt said come quick
  - There's a phenomenon and I'm in the thick of it
  - Riding around the badlands range
  - They came upon those creatures so strange
  - They're so small, they couldn't hurt you
  - Just like they said about Napoleon too
  - Oh, so cute, they're sneaking around
  - Hiding the crimes 'round the prairie dog town
  - They lay in wait 'neath the Dakota moon
  - For the chance to make you their next victim soon
  - Poppin' up, poppin' down
  - Burrowing, making their funny little sounds
  - Guarding the ground and rooting all around
  - Watch your dry bones in the prairie dog town
  - Went to a party at the prairie dog town
  - Hills and holes and manicured grounds
  - Gaiety and chattering was in the air
  - While grinning teeth waited to bite you there
  - Small of mind better watch your back
  - Need rapid-moving eyes just to keep track
  - Behind the Bush he makes the gut strings wail
  - You can't judge a dog by the wag of its tail
  - Poppin' up, poppin' down
  - Burrowing, making their funny little sounds
  - Guarding the ground and rooting all around
  - Watch your dry bones in the prairie dog town
  - Don't put your trust in a prairie dog
  - They'll rob you back and steal your drawers
  - Stay in your car behind the glass
  - Or you might get some big sharp teeth in that ass
  - Disregard the great ethical truths
  - It's the collective life of the herd for you
  - Closed society, no open door policy
  - Collectivist secretive ideology
  - Utilitarian sublimation of individual identities
  - Suppression of dissidents
  - Communal living country club victory
  - For him and her and she and he
  - Poppin' up, poppin' down
  - Burrowing, making their funny little sounds
  - Guarding the ground and rooting all around
  - Watch your dry bones in the prairie dog town
  - Poppin' up, poppin' down
  - Burrowing, making their funny little sounds
  - Guarding the ground and rooting all around
  - Watch your dry bones in the prairie dog town
  - All them cows steppin' in the host

  - He lifted up the snake overhead so high
  - Eyes closed tight but he praised the sky

  - There were tambourines and moans and wails
  - Wrappin' the snakes on the healing trail
  - But a child passed, it was the devil and the snake
  - And the devil prevailed
  - Big deep trouble for a young child gone
  - Maybe the book and the verse was all wrong
  - Keep your eyes closed, your lips sealed tight
  - Keep your mind right
  - Whoa no, whoa no
  - Good Lord lift this heavy load
  - Maybe I'm going down a wrong road
  - Well oh no, no, no
  - Hallelujah and praise the man
  - Upstairs with the long hand
  - Wrap the snake and the angels sing
  - Take your ride with the preacher in the ring
  - Lawmen went to the house on the hill
  - Found the wife and the wind so still
  - A woman and a rope and a kicked-over chair and a beam too high
  - Thrown out of town got to find a new site
  - Someone said it's like the Israelites
  - They say the persecuted ones gonna find the light
  - Whoa no, so long
  - Copperheads and sacred songs
  - The book of Mark well it couldn't be wrong
  - Well, oh no, no, no
  - Hallelujah and praise the man
  - Upstairs with the long hand
  - Wrap the snake and watch 'em all sting
  - As they go ten rounds with the preacher in the ring

  - Well he came to town with a strong pull
  - Would flash his moves for the worshipful
  - Shoulder moves from side to side
  - Go over your head and dot your eyes
  - Every night about a quarter to ten
  - From the middle of June to the summer's end
  - People would gather from miles around
  - To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down
  - He'd pull up from around the back
  - Folks say, "There's Rainbow's Cadillac"
  - Fancy shirts and shorts of plaid
  - Coat of more colors than Joseph had
  - Every night about a quarter to ten
  - From the middle of June to the summer's end
  - People would gather from miles around
  - To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down
  - Take a quarter from the collection plate
  - Every night he would dominate
  - Jump to the top and pick off a dime
  - Throw it down at the proper time
  - Every night about a quarter to ten
  - From the middle of June to the summer's end
  - People would gather from miles around
  - To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down

  - I'm on a long sojourn
  - I'm sitting here shedding my skin
  - Don't know about inside, ugly on the outside
  - They're all messing with me for the shape I'm in
  - I'm looking for a clean slate
  - Just need to find a new mind state
  - Hey, let's go looking for squirrels
  - Let's find something to do
  - I think she's shooting it right at you
  - Look down I said right at you
  - And the hail falls hard
  - And the wind whips my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from anywhere real safe
  - And the storm clouds are flying high
  - Mud all over my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from my resting place
  - Hey, let's duck down this side street
  - Maybe no, nobody else will see
  - Everybody sees us as big fat bastards
  - But I can just see you looking at me
  - Ever feel like a side-show attraction
  - Ever feel like a walking infraction
  - Some people call me Tarzan in my big, big sweats
  - Don't know just what they mean
  - Maybe not good, real bad I bet
  - And the hail falls hard
  - And the wind whips my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from some sheltered space
  - And the storm clouds are flying high
  - Mud all over my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from my resting place
  - I'm looking for a clean slate
  - Just need to find a new way, way to relate
  - You ever feel like a street walker
  - I get by being a funny talker
  - All those funny jokes sting, so keep walkin'
  - And the hail falls hard
  - And the wind whips my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from some sheltered space
  - And the storm clouds are flying high
  - Mud all over my face
  - And I'm a long, long way from my resting place

  - I think maybe I knew her in school
  - In my memory's faded view
  - I remember years ago
  - Her name I barely knew
  - Years later I saw her in town
  - Knocking on my window talking loud
  - She said, "Baby do you need a date
  - Or just a little foolin' around"
  - Way down where the red light's low
  - Slinkin' down where the bad seeds grow
  - Crawlin' where the sun don't show
  - '''Neath the sad moon'
  - Walking the streets, all on display
  - Standing there and laying in wait
  - She looks at me and I look away
  - '''Neath the sad moon'
  - I said, "Thanks, no I don't need that"
  - But as she turned her naked back
  - 'She turned to go, and '
  - I just had to stare at her walking away
  - Looking out there it might be me
  - But for the grace of God, oh, I can see
  - A grain of sand, a strand of hair
  - A chromosome of someone's dare
  - Way down where the red light's low
  - Slinkin' down where the bad seeds grow
  - Crawlin' where the sun don't show
  - '''Neath the sad moon'
  - Walking the streets, all on display
  - Standing there and laying in wait
  - She looks at me and I look away
  - '''Neath the sad moon'
  - Couldn't help but follow her
  - Felt so bad but couldn't stop
  - Curiosity's got me
  - Worth a damn I know I'm not
  - I put her down, but want her too
  - Ashamed to say I want her a lot
  - Guess I'll go and move along
  - Let it go, let it drop
  - Way down where the red light's low
  - Slinkin' down where the bad seeds grow
  - Crawlin' where the sun don't show
  - '''Neath the sad moon'
  - Walking the streets, all on display
  - Standing there and laying in wait
  - She looks at me and I look away
  - '''Neath the sad moon'

  - There was a little girl picked up a doll
  - Oh, so white as snow
  - Said this is me as I really am
  - Same little girl picked up a doll
  - Looked just like her
  - And threw it away in the garbage, the garbage can
  - One man in a courtroom with a grim-faced stare
  - A sea of armchair experts judging what's said
  - One man saw another man, oh, that could've been him
  - One man and a woman saw nothing but red, red, red
  - You're looking at a picture
  - I'm looking at it too
  - Do you see what I see today, hey
  - Let's talk about the difference
  - Find out what's in the way
  - Open our eyes, see the same
  - See the same way
  - One man saw a healer doing such good, good things
  - One man saw a sinner by the Holy Sea
  - Well Jesus and the Pharisees didn't see eye to eye
  - But the man on the shore saw so clearly
  - You're looking at a picture
  - I'm looking at it too

  - I want to be at the meeting
  - Well, I want to be in that number
  - When we all see, see the same
  - See the same way
  - One man saw a million men
  - Standing in peaceful grace
  - One man saw nobody missing work
  - Telling lots of bad jokes
  - Might just make you feel good
  - But you never know who you
  - Who you hurt with your words
  - You're looking at a picture
  - I'm looking at it too
  - Do you see what I see today, hey
  - Let's talk about the difference
  - Find out what's in the way
  - Open our eyes, see the same
  - See the same way, hey now
  - There was a man playing G.I. Joe
  - Way back there in the woods
  - In training for the coming of the promised war
  - Seeing all conspiracy
  - Needs somebody to blame
  - If only he could open up
  - Love a little more, hmm
  - You're looking at a picture
  - I'm looking at it too
  - Do you see what I see today, hey

  - It's not like me to come out and help you
  - Mabye I've been down this road before
  - Been living in the shadows
  - Now you come out slow
  - Now you're in the saddle
  - Got to ride a long
  - Now your dream was shattered
  - These days are through
  - Maybe something mattered
  - It's not just for you
  - Some are gonna go for broke
  - Some will lay down
  - I've been too long standing still
  - All I know is whenever you need me
  - You reach out and set me in motion
  - Looking out on that long valley
  - Telling me I've come so far
  - You're the reason I finally got there
  - You're the reason it's been so hard
  - Been living in the shadows
  - Now you hear the call
  - Now you're in the saddle
  - You got to ride or fall
  - Now you push a little harder
  - Like I showed you to
  - There's a day you'll be calling
  - And I'll look you to you
  - Some are gonna go for broke
  - Some will lay down
  - I've been too long standing still
  - 'All I know is whenever you need me '

  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - Shaking my shadow hand
  - In light of all I've learned so far
  - I don't believe I'm so strange
  - In spite of all this time I spend
  - Calling the air by a name
  - When the first light goes over the trees
  - He will be singing with me
  - And if I feel like singing alone
  - He always leaves me be
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - As the sun moves round the bend
  - With an imaginary man
  - And we'll make believe around and around again
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - There's a man out walking around in the night
  - A lantern in his hand
  - Looking all around, searching in vain
  - For an honest man
  - In my little world of make-believe
  - I talk to myself or my friend
  - If some real life comes tempting me
  - I'm going back in my room again
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - As the sun moves round the bend
  - With an imaginary man
  - And we'll make believe around and around again
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - So nice to pretend, think I'll do it again
  - No cards to send, no torn heart to mend
  - A little imagination and then
  - A world of fantasy with my friend
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - As the sun moves round the bend
  - With an imaginary man
  - And we'll make believe around and around again
  - I'm shaking my shadow hand
  - As the sun moves round the bend
  - With an imaginary man
  - And we'll make believe again
  - It's my shadow hand

  - In my Shadowland

  - Proved down deep oh all alone
  - Sold my pride for a song
  - Lost my way but I'll go on, and I'll go on
  - Here I sit, dirt on my hands
  - It's the only way out in the Shadowland
  - In this Shadowland

  - And he stands at the banquet room bar
  - Looking over the crowd
  - The reunion band playing too loud
  - And he sees his fellow old star
  - Looks him up and down
  - Sees a little of himself in his frown
  - The stander on the mountain
  - Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some
  - About the old days
  - King of the mountain
  - Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
  - When he was the one
  - And the stander on the mountain runs
  - Let us sit and talk of old times
  - That's what we're supposed to do
  - And you don't look a day over thirty-two
  - Yes we were so funny and wild
  - There's an old friend of mine
  - Says I'm looking back most all the time
  - And the stander on the mountain
  - Listens to the sound of the city streets, the lonely heat
  - The town he once owned
  - King of the mountain
  - Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
  - When he was the one
  - And the stander on the mountain runs
  - King of the hill runs away
  - Oh she's knocking on your door tonight
  - Oh she wants to see if she remembers right
  - Say won't you come outside tonight
  - Alright
  - They drive to the lookout on the hill
  - And when it was over
  - They sat there and looked back
  - Tomorrow was way in the distance
  - Tomorrow was a long time away
  - Nobody thought much about it
  - And there's nothing wrong if we live for today
  - I recall when you filled it on up
  - And you bowed to the crowd
  - The girls in the short skirts screaming loud
  - The stander on the mountain
  - Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some
  - About the old days
  - Big man around town
  - Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
  - When he was the one
  - And the stander on the mountain runs

  - Bright light streaming in through my window pane
  - Think I'll stare at the shapes it makes
  - On the floor and then stare again
  - You've got your curtains drawn
  - Anything I can do?
  - Maybe a rose or a pillow or a picture
  - Or a funny joke just for you
  - To carry you away
  - Let me bring you some tokens of esteem
  - Close the door on the world
  - Make it our own beautiful scene
  - There's a darkness visible, maybe only to me
  - Maybe just a dream, a time-slowing-down dream
  - A hole you're sinking down deep
  - Comes loose at the seams, make the dream leave
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those convicting may be the guilitiest of all
  - Wash it away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray
  - Some halcyon days
  - Feel a strong gravitational pull holding you down
  - And the air feels thick, having a hard time
  - Moving through, moving 'round
  - I'm hoping you may let me help to pull you through
  - You're here, so you might as well let me see
  - If I can do that for you
  - Carry you away
  - Feeling so helpless, mostly I'm a clown
  - Every now and then gotten so even
  - Up can feel like down
  - In the hour of my reflection
  - I've had enough of disaffection
  - Like a starless sky, no light in our eyes
  - Maybe change this tonight
  - Some brighter times, some lovely rhymes
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those in judgment could be guiltiest of all
  - Wash it away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray
  - Some halcyon days
  - Maybe just a dream, some ever-present dream, evanescent scenes
  - It could seem so for me, this is for me
  - Some rise by wrong
  - And some by virtue fall
  - And those in judgment could be guiltiest of all
  - Wash it away
  - I'd love to bring you, on a silver tray
  - Some halcyon days

  - One eye is open, the other eye is shut

  - When I escape and close my eyes
  - Can't tell you from me
  - Sometimes in the dreams I look at myself
  - And it looks so good, what I see
  - I'm having a little trouble here
  - Could you maybe help me out?
  - A little confidence pill you got
  - To take away my self-doubt

  - Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea?
  - Don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me?
  - Now the winter time is coming, the windows are filled with frost
  - I want to tell everybody, but I could not get across

  - Promises of treats I bring

  - Doesn't change anything

  - Here today, gone tomorrow
  - Little ones can't hide their sorrow

  - See you holding back a tear
  - The moment when I disappear
  - You look and look until it's clear
  - He's gone for a long time
  - You say don't make a special trip here
  - Please don't because I fear
  - Some of my new friends
  - Might just spy a tear

  - Not much at all

  - And I hear 'em out hitting on a Coleman song
  - My friend John with a mirror and spoon
  - Got a belt and a mainline scene
  - A couple getting off in the back room
  - Someone's collecting money for the friend in need
  - Sounds like a good time, a ball to me
  - Sounds like a place I'd like to be
  - There's a little crowd you're gonna want to meet
  - Oh, they got a thing going on swing street
  - Nice old man in the corner booth
  - Making time with Jive-time Stu
  - She makes her sting 'neath the table blue
  - Says she's an actor but she's hooking
  - As a sideline too
  - Oh, sounds like a good time, a ball to me
  - Sounds like a place I'd like to be
  - Everybody rolls when it's time to meet
  - Oh, they got a thing going on swing street
  - Got a good thing going down swing street
  - They say there's nothing but bums around here
  - Listen to the sound of the cymbal so clear
  - Cutting contest on the stand
  - Somebody's trying to blow you away
  - What makes him swing harder than you do
  - Oh, better hit the woodshed for ninety days
  - Oh, sounds like a good time, a ball to me
  - Sounds like a place I'd like to be

  - A ride
  - Looking for a wildest enemy
  - Then only I know you can never care
  - Man of the world and everywhere
  - Get your hot pots in the pantry then

  - Waiting in a yellow crane
  - Though you couldn't give a shit
  - This order that is heaven sent
  - Take, take, take, take out the trash
  - Take out the nasty pile of mash
  - Watch out the baby gonna give you a rash
  - Oh Lord, take out the trash
  - You're such a big shot wannabe
  - Pleading around for all to see
  - I know you're special and very clean
  - But you got to take out the daily greens
  - Joking at explosives
  - Langerous and listless
  - Compelling out of more pep
  - Expensive and explosive
  - Take, take, take, take out the trash
  - Take out the nasty pile of mash
  - Take out the fallen grey hash
  - Hey, take out the trash
  - Watch it better how you stash
  - Here's the chance to make a splash
  - Take out the trash
  - I am called extraordinaire
  - Witty and eloquent
  - Observing and a motive
  - Expensive and explosive
  - Take, take, take, take out the thrash

  - In some pocket and some cash
  - Take out the trash
  - Take out the trash
  - Take out the trash

  - Don't smell your finger
  - Your stinking finger
  - Wallowing the funk
  - Wallowing in the stink
  - Your friend with red ink
  - He's wallowing in the stink
  - Keep wallowing in the stink

  - But something's been omitted by the writers of history
  - Now stand up all unsung heroes who made this world for you and me
  - Jamestown
  - Night crawlers cleared the forests of seedlings, nuts and leaves
  - And everything everywhere dried up and the natives got the dry heaves
  - Mosquitoes brought malaria and bees brought their hives
  - And the Indians got less scarier with yellow skin and eyes
  - Hoorah, hooray, the black rats of London
  - They crossed the sea for you and me
  - Let's raise a glass so thankfully
  - Hail, hail, hooray, the black rats of London
  - Made the long treacherous passage to
  - Spread their natural juices, a gift to you, a gift to you
  - Yorktown
  - Parasites decimated the red army of Cornwallis and his flock
  - Standing weakly on Yorktown battlefield with measles and small pox
  - Horses, hogs, chickens and dogs and John Rolfe's prized worms
  - Divine intervention, bacterial strains from imported English dirt

  - And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
  - Didn't have a care in the world
  - Mother and daddy standing by
  - But "happily ever after" fails
  - We've been poisoned by these fairy tales
  - Lawyers dwell on small details
  - Since daddy had to fly
  - I know a place where we can go
  - Still untouched by men
  - We could sit and watch the clouds roll by
  - The tall grass waves in the wind
  - You can lay your head back on the ground
  - Let your hair fall all around me
  - Offer up your best defense
  - This is the end
  - This is the end of the innocence
  - O beautiful for spacious skies
  - Now those skies are threatening
  - Beating plowshares into swords
  - For that tired old man that's no longer king
  - Armchair warriors often fail
  - We've been poisoned by these fairy tales
  - Lawyers dwell on small details
  - Since daddy had to fly
  - I know a place where we can go
  - Wash away this sin
  - We could sit and watch the clouds roll by
  - The tall grass waves in the wind
  - You can lay your head back on the ground
  - Let your hair fall all around me
  - Offer up your best defense
  - This is the end
  - This is the end of the innocence
  - Who knows how long this will last
  - Now we've come so far, so fast
  - But somewhere back there in the dust
  - That same small town in each of us
  - I need to remember this
  - So baby give me just one kiss
  - Come and take a long last look
  - Before we say goodbye
  - You can lay your head back on the ground
  - Let your hair fall all around me
  - Offer up your best defense
  - This is the end
  - This is the end of the innocence

  - I'm gonna buy a big red truck
  - Then a rabbit's foot for real good luck
  - Gonna get me some plastic Gunga Dins
  - Then I'll buy a big house to put 'em all in
  - I'll buy a new suit when I'm feelin' down
  - Picks me up and I'll show it around
  - I'll wear it once or twice I'm sure
  - Then I'll get another when I'm feelin' the urge
  - I'm living the good life
  - I got my beautiful things so high as a kite
  - Living the good life
  - I buy and buy so high in the sky
  - I'll buy the special meal with the prize
  - And toys with the motorized blinkin' eyes
  - And lunch and dinner there I'll be
  - My favorite character eluding me
  - There's a sale down at the Five And Dime
  - And everything's going for dirt this time
  - I don't need this but it's so cheap
  - The visions of a bargain in my sleep
  - I'm living the good life
  - I got my beautiful things so high as a kite
  - Living the good life
  - I buy and buy so high in the sky
  - Living the good life
  - I got my beautiful things so high as a kite
  - I'm living the good life
  - I buy and buy so high in the sky
  - These wonderful items everywhere
  - A house full of things but I don't care
  - I wonder as I'm sitting there
  - Maybe I'll feel better in a brand new chair
  - I'm living the good life
  - I got my beautiful things so high as a kite
  - Living the good life
  - I buy and buy so high as a kite
  - Living the good life
  - I got my beautiful things so high as a kite
  - I'm living the good life
  - I buy and buy so high in the sky
  - I'm living the good life

  - Someone's dancing on the table
  - Someone's got an old book in the back
  - Some old jocks sitting round their neighbors
  - Exaggerating their stats again
  - There's Mr. D.E. in the corner
  - Dancing with Miss Virginia former
  - I didn't think I'd really have a good time
  - But I don't remember you looking so fine
  - It's been a long dark night all right
  - I've been running on a low love light
  - Maybe the longest night
  - Maybe it's over, over tonight, hey, yeah
  - Most everyone all around
  - Most have an interesting story
  - Even those who don't have much to say
  - Even interest me when they're just boring to him
  - Then there's Mr. B.M.O.C.
  - Talking so loud to Mr. P.E.
  - Someone said that his best days are past
  - But I know this first chance won't be the last
  - It's been a long dark night all right
  - I've been running on a low love light
  - Maybe the longest night
  - Maybe it's over, over tonight
  - Hey now Mr. D.J.
  - Keep those good songs coming
  - '''Cause I''m having such a good time tonight'
  - Moving making up for so much long lost time
  - Not much going since the old days
  - One long solo ride
  - I came here just to live in the past
  - But maybe I'm seeing the future at last
  - It's been a long dark night all right
  - I've been running on a low love light
  - Maybe the longest night
  - Maybe it's over, over tonight

  - Four walls I built one winter
  - She came to share my name
  - For years we lived as lovers on the open plains
  - Far off the heat wave shimmers
  - Pipelines and the gasoline
  - One day it all came running like a bad dream
  - Fire, smoke-filled lungs
  - I hope I'll be standing when the day is done
  - Yeah, we're...
  - Staring out on the red plains
  - And we're hiding out from the smoke and the rage
  - A lifetime living on the red plains
  - Watching out as it all goes up in flames
  - Get up on Sunday morning
  - Repent for Friday night
  - Don't let 'em tell you it's gonna be a fair fight
  - I gave her clothes and a diamond
  - She loved the things that shine
  - But one day the gold and the silver got left behind
  - Fire, smoke-filled rooms
  - I hope I'll be standing when the day is through
  - Yeah, we're staring out on the red plains
  - And we're hiding out from the blood and the smoke
  - A lifetime living on the red plains
  - Watching out as it all blows up in flames
  - Fire, smoke-filled rooms
  - I hope I'll be standing when the day is through
  - Yeah, we're...

  - Down in the southwest Virginia town of Richlands
  - I fell in love with an Appalachian girl
  - She lived in a long line of little row houses
  - On the side of an old strip mining hill
  - She walked along on the jagged ridge
  - And looked as far as she could see
  - But the hills out there so up and down
  - You only see as far as the next big ridge
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow of on the hill
  - Another time and another place
  - I feel her in my heart still
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow in the bend
  - I see her in my mind and then
  - I go down the road not taken... again
  - Oh the coal dust sttles on the window display
  - They have to change it about every other day
  - Some things never change way out here
  - An outsider could always remain that way
  - She walked along on the jagged ridge
  - She told me she was thinking of me
  - But every time I tried to take her away
  - She alway ran back to the rocks and the trees
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow of on the hill
  - Another time and another place
  - I feel her in my heart still
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow in the bend
  - I see her in my mind and then
  - I go down the road not taken... again
  - Oh I went back there after many years
  - So curious and so secretly
  - As I looked on I held back a tear
  - The road not taken overcoming me
  - Oh I saw her she was sitting there
  - Older, thinner on the front porch
  - It seemed the light a little brighter there
  - Or maybe I still carried the forgotten torch
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow of on the hill
  - Another time and another place
  - I feel her in my heart still
  - Everytime I see her face
  - On the street in the hollow in the bend
  - I see her in my mind and then
  - I go down the road not taken... again

  - What's the long face, what's all the crying for
  - Didn't you expect it since you opened your door
  - To the man with the long coat and the long list of victims
  - Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score
  - From where she sits everyone stands in judgement
  - Everybody watching as the curtain falls down
  - See the lights do a long slow fade
  - The show goes on and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
  - Everyone watching all along
  - The show goes on as the autumn's coming
  - And the summer's all gone
  - Still without you, the show goes on
  - Some say she's all right, some say she'll never learn
  - Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn
  - I've been here all along, and I've been standing here all this time
  - But you never, never noticed, let the same tired flames burn
  - From where she sits everyone stands in judgment
  - Everybody watching as the curtain falls down
  - See the lights do a long slow fade
  - The show goes on and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
  - Everyone watching all along
  - The show goes on as the autumn's coming
  - And the summer's all gone
  - Still without you, the show goes on
  - Time is passing, slowly passing you by
  - You better try, try to find it before it passes you by
  - As I watch you walking to another cold dawn
  - And you keep on walking and they keep on talking about you
  - They're talking all along
  - From where she sits everyone stands in judgment
  - Everybody watching as the curtain falls down
  - See the lights do a long slow fade
  - The show goes on and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
  - Everyone watching all along
  - The show goes on as the autumn's coming
  - And the summer's all gone
  - Still without you, the show goes on

  - Left allemand, and do-pah-so time
  - Here she comes, coming round the bend
  - Been to the bathroom and going back again
  - Fix the hair - baby, powder that shine
  - Just to give a good cold shoulder next time
  - Been around town and we're going again
  - '"Hallelujah" when you get to the end'
  - Summer's come now, don't you feel the sting?
  - All goin' down, looking for the Tango King
  - Look at Pete, he's a lounge hand
  - All want to stand in where he stands
  - Spin that girl 'neath the colored ball
  - Fancy plaid man's the envy of all
  - Been around town and we're going again

  - Most times I come up short
  - Got to pull up the lines
  - Got to move around the bend
  - They say it's a dying breed
  - They say it's going to disappear
  - Nothing I can do, oh but pull up the load again
  - The tide will rise
  - And the tide will fall
  - We'll be out on the water
  - Before the break of dawn
  - The tide will rise
  - And the tide will fall
  - Oh, we'll be working on the water
  - When the long, long day is gone
  - Full moon it was always best
  - Keep a little and you sell the rest
  - Living on hope that the seed is sown again
  - Red sky in the evening
  - Better times are coming up they say
  - Well, why do I feel like it's all coming to an end
  - The tide will rise
  - And the tide will fall
  - We'll be out on the water
  - Before the break of dawn
  - The tide will rise
  - And the tide will fall

  - When the seed is broken
  - Nothing left to grow on
  - When you lose the seed
  - It's hard to bring it on back
  - Never bowed to no one
  - Always went my own way
  - Broke down, run around, but I won't run away
  - And the tide will rise
  - The tide will rise
  - And the tide will fall
  - We'll be out on the water

  - Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
  - This time I'll go where she wants me to go
  - She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
  - Deep in the woods, down the low valley road
  - While no one was looking on the old plantation
  - He took her all the way down the long valley road
  - They sent her away not too much later
  - And left him walking down the old valley road
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on alone, alone
  - Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
  - Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
  - Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
  - Everybody knew what they were talking about
  - While no one was looking on the old plantation
  - He showed her what they do down the long valley road
  - She came back around like nothing really happened
  - And left him standing on the old valley road
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on, walk on, on the valley road
  - Standing like a stone on the old plantation
  - The rich old man would have never let him in
  - Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
  - When it all happens, nobody wins
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone, alone

  - And the rice was gone -whoa- hours ago,
  - And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone.
  - Well they met at the club where the brasses blow
  - Where the wine did flow, oh, he moved so slow.
  - But finally, one night, as the wind stood still,
  - He got up the nerve, and she said, "I will."
  - Well, the day did come, and the groomsmen arrived.
  - Came a little early to go over their lines.
  - As they walked to the church on the cobblestones,
  - Was it heard in the bushes with a moan and a groan.
  - Well she walks into town in a long white gown,
  - And the band plays on with no one around,
  - And the rice was gone four hours ago,
  - And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone.
  - Well, she didn't want to think that she lived a lie.
  - There was always talk of a wand'ring eye.
  - Well, he'd come to the club, and he'd look all around.
  - It took a fair-minded man not to wonder aloud.

  - And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone.
  - And the father of the bride is drinking so slow...
  - White wheeled limousine standing alone.
  - Standing, standing alone!
  - White wheeled limousine standing alone.
  - Standing, standing alone!
  - White wheeled limousine standing alone.
  - Standing, standing alone!
  - White wheeled limousine standing alone.
  - Standing, standing alone!

  - Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
  - This time I'll go where she wants me to go
  - She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
  - Deep in the woods down the low valley road
  - While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
  - He took her all the way down the long valley road
  - They sent her away not too much later
  - And left him walking down the old valley road
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on alone, alone
  - Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
  - Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
  - Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
  - Everybody knew what they were talking about
  - Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
  - He showed her what they do down the long valley road
  - She came back around like nothing really happened
  - And left him standing on the old valley road
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on, walk on, walk on the valley road
  - Standing like a stone on the old plantation
  - The rich old man would have never let him in
  - Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
  - When it all happens, nobody wins
  - Walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone, alone
  - Walk on, walk on
  - Walk on, walk on alone
  - Walk on, walk on

  - Well, she moved back around here
  - Thirty-five weeks ago today
  - Oh, down the lane
  - Well, at night she walks on the banks
  - And remembers how she dreamed of rowing away
  - And how she left one day
  - She left with a driven look in her eyes
  - Came back around with it still inside
  - They said give it some time and you'll forget about it too
  - We know they always do
  - Well, I know some fine day
  - You will find your way
  - Across the river, across the river
  - Row down slow
  - There's a long way to go
  - Across the river, across the river
  - She was proud and so strong
  - But she tried not to listen to idle talk
  - Downtown where she walked
  - Well, they sit around and they say
  - That she came back with her tail between her legs
  - Like they always said she would
  - Well, I hear it's better on the other side
  - They say you'll never do it so don't even try
  - Well, you may be beaten down with your closed mind
  - But don't try to make it mine
  - Well, I know some fine day
  - You will find your way
  - Across the river, across the river
  - Row down slow
  - There's a long way to go
  - Across the river, across the river
  - Is what they said
  - I dreamed she came and I went down
  - And I walked where she led
  - Standing on the shore
  - She looks to the west with a look of longing
  - To where the grass seems greener
  - Well, there's a hard and distant prize
  - It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
  - Well, even if it doesn't happen for me
  - It still beats hanging around here
  - Well, I know some fine day
  - You will find your way
  - Across the river, across the river
  - Row down slow
  - There's a long, long way to go
  - Across the river, across the river
  - River, across the river
  - ' across the river'

  - There were people living in a green valley
  - Found a way to make a lot of money
  - Made the green turn gradually gray
  - They figured they could do whatever they wanted
  - Everything would be alright
  - But scars don't always heal away
  - And the sons and the daughters
  - Got diamonds and gold
  - But they were given a land where
  - Strong roots never take hold
  - Good seed don't grow
  - On the barren ground
  - Good things don't come along
  - As you just sit dreaming on
  - Good seed don't grow
  - On the barren ground
  - Say everything fades away
  - There you are still around
  - What'll you do where will you go
  - There was a ship along the coast
  - Carrying a whole of black money
  - In the sound near the northern lights
  - When the ship set sail
  - The crew looked for guidance
  - In the bottom of an empty glass
  - And the captain said
  - '"Pour me another rye"'
  - Then the water turned black
  - As a cold winter's night
  - Good seed don't grow
  - On the barren ground
  - Good things don't come along
  - As you just sit dreaming on
  - Good seed don't grow
  - On the barren ground
  - Say everything fades away
  - There you are still around

  - It's coming any day now cried the priest
  - The people in high places may defend you
  - But son you better hope they keep the peace
  - Can't you hear them calling
  - Can't you see them shine
  - The city halls are falling
  - The defenders drink their wine
  - And when the party's over
  - Their stomachs start to sag
  - Defenders, defenders of the flag
  - The congregation's waiting at the altar
  - They can't find the preacher anywhere
  - They found him with the new girl from the choir
  - Where they store the boxes of the book of prayer
  - If these guys are the good ones
  - I don't want to know the bad
  - You wonder how it happened
  - They just picked it up from dad
  - Faded old glory hanging like a rag
  - Defenders, defenders of the flag
  - The flag is flying high over the courthouse
  - The wheels of justice never stood a chance
  - The judge is down at Charlie's on his lunch hour
  - Checking out the picture show from France
  - Carrying a fifth of whiskey
  - In a dirty paper bag
  - Threw the ball to home
  - But they always missed the tag
  - Faded old glory hanging like a rag

  - Every little one, every little one
  - Everybody here's a number, not a name
  - But I guess it's all right with me
  - As I sit alone after a long day
  - In the absence of company
  - I let my mind wander
  - A thousand miles away
  - What I wouldn't give for only one night

  - There was a man of confused and sad nature
  - Thought no one loved him, that was not true
  - He said he was a lost soul, didn't fit in anywhere
  - Didn't know where to turn or who to turn to
  - There's a lost soul coming down the road
  - Somewhere between two worlds
  - With an oar in his hands and a song on your lips
  - We'll row the boat to the far shore
  - Row the boat of love, lost soul
  - Ever since, oh, I can remember
  - We all tried to ease the pain
  - Took him in when he needed some shelter
  - Tried to make him feel he was one of us again
  - There was one day, oh, I can remember
  - He sat alone with a pencil in his hand
  - All day long he drew careful on the paper
  - In the end just a picture of a man
  - There's the lost soul coming down the road
  - Somewhere between two worlds
  - With an oar in his hands and a song on your lips
  - We'll row the boat to the far shore
  - Row the boat of love, lost soul
  - Oh, dear Mary, do you remember
  - The day we went walking downtown
  - As I recall, it was in early December
  - After school had just let out
  - When I see you on the street in the twilight
  - I may tip my hat and keep my head down
  - You show me love, but maybe I don't deserve it
  - I've been called but not been found
  - There's a lost soul coming down the road
  - Somewhere between two worlds
  - With an oar in his hands and a song on your lips
  - We'll row the boat to the far shore
  - Row the boat of love, lost soul

  - Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
  - I laughed and she'd smile
  - It would last for awhile
  - You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again

  - Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
  - Oh, listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears roll
  - Down my face as she turns to go
  - A cool evening dance
  - Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill
  - From the air until they play the last song
  - I'll do my time
  - Oh, keeping you off my mind but there's moments
  - That I find, I'm not feeling so strong
  - Listen to the mandolin rain
  - Listen to the music on the lake
  - Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
  - Oh, listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears roll
  - Down my face as she turns to go
  - Runnin' down by the lakeshore
  - She did love the sound of a summer storm
  - It played on the lake like a mandolin
  - Now it's washing her away once again, whoa again
  - The boat's steaming in
  - Oh, I watch the side wheel spin
  - And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
  - I can't change my mind
  - Oh, I knew all the time that she'd go
  - But that's a choice I made long ago
  - Listen to the mandolin rain
  - Listen to the music on the lake
  - Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
  - Oh, listen to the banjo wind
  - A sad song drifting low
  - Listen to the tears roll
  - Down my face as she turns to go
  - As she turns to go
  - Listen to the...listen to the mandolin rain

  - I was lost, in trouble and strife
  - I heard a voice and it changed my life
  - And now it's a brand new day,
  - And I ain't ashamed to say
  - You're not alone, when you're down and out
  - I think you know who I'm talkin' about
  - When I don't know how I'll get through
  - I ask myself, what would Willie do?
  - Long ago, he came unto us
  - His words were simple,
  - But they went right through us
  - And the whole world sang along,
  - But then they didn't want to hear his songs
  - He was gone, and we thought we'd lost him
  - But he'd just grew his hair and moved to Austin
  - And all of the people smiled
  - They came to hear him sing from miles
  - And like a miracle all the rednecks and the hippies,
  - From New York city down to Mississippi
  - Stood together and raised a brew
  - When it's all gone wrong
  - What would Willie do?
  - You know sometimes I wonder,
  - When I ain't gettin' nowhere
  - What would Willie do,
  - When things get too much to bear
  - I can see him sittin' on his lonely old bus
  - And he's got his problems just like any of us
  - I bet he'd just take a deep breath,
  - And he'd let 'em all go
  - And then he'd take another deep breath,
  - And he'd let 'em all go
  - And then he'd take another deep breath,
  - And he'd hold it
  - And then I bet he'd feel hungry,
  - In a way that seems strange
  - Yes hungry, for all the things he just can't change
  - Like the time he passed out in his own bedroom
  - And his ex-wife sewed him up in the sheet,
  - And she beat him with a broom,
  - And he forgave her
  - And you think that that's rough,
  - Then the IRS came and they took away all his stuff
  - They took his golf course and his recording studio
  - And he just went on out and did another show
  - So when it's all coming down on you
  - I think you'd better ask yourself,
  - What would Willie do?
  - What would Willie do,
  - Well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
  - And a tour bus and some semi-trucks,
  - Thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
  - He loves all the people, the rank and the randy
  - If you don't believe it, take a look at the family
  - They'll tell you that it's true
  - When it's all too much, what would Willie do?
  - What would Willie do, he'd take a little time
  - And talk to old Rooster as they drive on down the line
  - There's millions down that road,
  - And with a word he's gonna lighten their load
  - He loves all the people no matter their races
  - Hell he even made a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
  - And that ain't easy to do
  - When it's all too much
  - When the game gets rough
  - When they call your bluff
  - What would Willie do?

  - That hypnotized me with love
  - She was a gypsy woman
  - She was a gypsy woman

  - And kiss her hair and whisper in her ear
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - All through the caravan
  - She was dancing with all the men
  - Waiting for the rising sun
  - Everyone was having fun
  - Hated to see her go
  - Knowing that she'll never know
  - That I love her
  - That I love her
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - I love you gypsy woman
  - Whoever compared it to Part Monkey Part Man hit the nail on the head. It has that
    same kind of dark, mysterious sound. The vocals are soft and understated, somewhat
    reminiscent to those on If I should fall behind or Pony Boy. The song is sung
    with that nasally twang Bruce has grown so fond of lately.

  - While riding on a train goin' west,
  - I fell asleep for to take my rest.
  - I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
  - Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
  - With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
  - Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
  - Where we together weathered many a storm,
  - Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.
  - By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
  - Our words were told, our songs were sung,
  - Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied
  - Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.
  - With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,
  - We never thought we could ever get old.
  - We thought we could sit forever in fun
  - But our chances really was a million to one.
  - As easy it was to tell black from white,
  - It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
  - And our choices were few and the thought never hit
  - That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.
  - How many a year has passed and gone,
  - And many a gamble has been lost and won,
  - And many a road taken by many a friend,
  - And each one I've never seen again.
  - I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,
  - That we could sit simply in that room again.
  - Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
  - I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

  - If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
  - If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
  - When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay
  - Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
  - Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
  - Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
  - Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well
  - Don't it make you feel bad
  - When you're tryin' to find your way home
  - You don't know which way to go?
  - If you're goin' down South
  - They go no work to do
  - If you don't know about Chicago
  - Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
  - Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
  - When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move
  - All last night sat on the levee and moaned
  - All last night sat on the levee and moaned
  - Thinkin' about me baby and my happy home
  - Going, going to Chicago... Going to Chicago...
  - Sorry but I can't take you...
  - Going down... going down now... going down...

  - I'm riding along on a freight train
  - Bound for God only knows where
  - I left my home just this morning
  - And my heart is heavy with care
  - I quarreled with my dear old father
  - Because of the things I had done
  - He called me a drunkard and a gambler
  - Not fit to be called his son
  - I cursed and I swore at my father
  - I told him his words were a lie
  - I packed my few things in a bundle
  - And went to wish mother goodbye
  - My mother she broke down a-crying
  - '"My son, Oh, my son, do not leave'
  - Your poor mother's heart will be broken
  - And all my life long I shall grieve"
  - She kissed me and called me her darling
  - Around me her arms did she throw
  - I'll never forget that sad parting
  - When I went and told mother I must go
  - I know she'll be there by the window
  - Day after day as I roam
  - Watching, waiting, and praying
  - For a son who will never come home
  - 'So boys, take a wanderer''s warning:'
  - Don't break your poor mother's heart
  - Stay by her side, for she needs you
  - And let nothing tear you apart

  - And I saw a beggar old and grey
  - With his hands outstretched he asked the folks for pity
  - 'And it made me sad to hear him say:'
  - Oh I wonder, yes I wonder, will the angels way up yonder
  - Will the angels play their harps for me?
  - For my heart is growing dreary and my feet are growing weary
  - Will the angels play their haprs for me?
  - Oh a million miles I've travelled, and a million sights I've seen
  - And I'm ready for the glory soon to be
  - Oh I wonder, yes I wonder, will the angels way up yonder

  - Met a little girl in London
  - Curly hair and eyes of blue
  - Just listen while I tell my story
  - Show you what a girl can do
  - She wanted me to spend my money
  - To buy a pretty diamond stone
  - I put it on her hand on Sunday
  - Monday morning she was gone
  - Then I met a girl in Soho
  - Thought that she was on the square
  - Don't know where she went from Soho
  - But anyhow I paid the fare
  - I thought she was a shy young maiden
  - Because her cheeks were always red
  - But when I went to find my wallet
  - I found that I was shy instead
  - Then I thought I'd learnt my lesson
  - Thought that girls and I were through
  - Till I met a pretty maiden
  - Said she'd always love me true
  - Said she didn't want my money
  - But then she took it just the same
  - Because she saw that we got married
  - And now I am a married man
  - I used to be a carefree traveller
  - Used to be a regular sheik
  - Now I have to take my wages
  - Turn them over every week
  - Oh! Don't forget the things I tell you
  - A woman's heart is made of stone
  - You'd better listen to my warning
  - Leave the pruty girls alone

  - Now friends gather near, I want you to hear
  - A dream that I had last night
  - There's a land o'er the sea for you and for me
  - Where we won't have to struggle and fight
  - There's real feather beds where we lay our heads
  - And a nice private room for each one
  - There's shoes with soles and pants without holes
  - And no work up there to be done
  - In Poor Man's Heaven, the land of the free
  - There's nothing up there but good luck
  - There's strawberry pie that's twenty feet high
  - And whipped cream they bring in a truck
  - We'll own all the banks and shoot all the cranks
  - And we won't give a durn who we hurt
  - And the millionaire's son won't have so much fun
  - When we put him to shovelling dirt
  - We'll know how it feels in automobiles
  - With a footman to open the door
  - And folks that get smart, we'll take them apart
  - And spread them all over the floor
  - In Poor Man's Heaven, we'll run the whole place
  - And we won't have nothing to fear
  - We'll eat all we please, from ham and egg trees
  - That grow by a lake full of beer
  - We'll live on champagne and ride on the train
  - And sleep in the Pullman at night
  - And if someone should dare to ask for our fare
  - We'll haul off and put out his lights
  - We'll take a hand rail and open the jail
  - And let all the poor men out quick
  - And the sheriff's own mug we'll throw in the jug
  - And then throw the key in the creek
  - In Poor Man's Heaven we'll have our own way
  - No salt pork and beans over there
  - But we will be fed our breakfast in bed
  - And served by a fat millionaire
  - We won't need to yearn for money to burn
  - '''Cause we''ll own a big money press'
  - We'll run her full speed, and make all we need
  - And light our cigars with the rest
  - The landlords we'll take and tie to a stake
  - And make 'em give back all our dough
  - Then we'll let them sweat, and learn what they get
  - When they go to that hot place below
  - In Poor Man's Heaven we'll own our own home
  - And we won't have to work like a slave
  - Then we will be proud to sing right out loud
  - The land of the free and the brave

  - Give me my lover coat woman
  - Look in the other room and give me my blue suede shoes
  - Hand me my lover coat please honey
  - Look in the other room and give me my blue suede shoes
  - You know if I don't ever see you no more darling
  - I swear before god that will be too soon
  - I came home this morning, about half past ten
  - I knew it was something wrong, I couldn't even get in
  - I walked round to the back door to try to ring my bell
  - The things I saw my love, I'm afraid to tell
  - Hand me my lover coat darling
  - Honey please give me my blue suede shoes
  - But If I don't ever see you no more darling
  - I swear before God it will be too soon
  - Give me my leather jacket woman
  - Give me my blue shoes out the other room
  - Please give me my lover jacket lady
  - What about my blue shoes in the other room
  - '''Cause if I don''t never see you no more darling'
  - I wear before God that will be too soon

  - Just like this Coke

  - I've hit the bottom
  - Now I'm all alone

  - Seven days - a wedding to plan
  - One week and then I begin
  - My life of a happy married man
  - It's love - baby, it's love

  - One month of fighting the missus
  - I'm wondering now what the heck that this is
  - It's love - baby, it's love

  - Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
  - Heartbeat
  - Why does a love kiss stay in my memory?
  - Piddly pat
  - I know that new love thrills me
  - I know that true love will be
  - Heartbeat
  - Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
  - Heartbeat
  - Why do you skip when my baby's lips meet mine?
  - Heartbeat
  - Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign?
  - Piddly pat
  - And sing to me love's story
  - And bring to me love's glory
  - Heartbeat
  - Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

  - When you've loved someone
  - And then found you've lost
  - Why must a true heart be left to pay the cost
  - Why must a heart that has been true
  - Be broken and sad - so empty and blue
  - I gambled my heart and I lost it to you
  - Now I'll spend my life wondering why I love you
  - Someday you'll know - why I'm so blue
  - When you've gambled your heart
  - And you've lost it too
  - Why must it be the one you want most of all
  - They'll build you up and then let you fall
  - They'll lead you on - you'll think that they're true
  - They'll love you then leave you so empty and blue

  - She smiled and made my heart go boom
  - And everybody room at Smokey Joe's cafe

  - And from behind the counter - I saw a man
  - A chef's hat on his head and a knife in his hand
  - He grabbed me by the collar and began to shout
  - '"You better eat up all your beans, boy and clear right on out!"'
  - Well, I know I'll never eat again at Smokey Joe's cafe
  - And so I'll never see again at Smokey Joe's cafe
  - I'd rather eat my chili beans at Jim's or Jack's or John's or Gene's

  - If I had wings, I would fly through the bloomin' sky

  - Long, long years have vanished, and though he comes no more
  - Yet my anxious heart will start with each footfall at my door

  - John Henry was a steel-drivin' man
  - He drove farther than any of the crew
  - And every time his hammer went down
  - You could see that old steam drill moving through, Lord, Lord
  - You could see that old steam drill moving through
  - John Henry married him a woman
  - Her name was Polly Ann
  - John Henry got sick in the tunnel one day
  - And Polly drove steel like a man, Lord, Lord
  - Polly drove steel like a man
  - John Henry stepped up to his captain
  - Says, "Captain, here I stand
  - If I can't beat your steam-drivin' drill
  - Oh, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, Lord Lord
  - I'll die with my hammer in my hand"
  - John Henry hammered in the mountain
  - Till his hammer caught on fire
  - And the very last words I heard John Henry say
  - Was "A cool drink of water 'fore I die, Lord, Lord
  - Oh, a cool drink of vater 'fore I die"

  - There was a lady and a lady gay
  - Of children she had three
  - She sent them away to the North Countree
  - For to learn their grammaree
  - They had not been that very long
  - Scarcely six months and a day
  - When death, cruel death, came hasting along
  - And stole those babes away
  - It was just about ol' Christmastime
  - The nights being cold and clear
  - She looked and saw her three little babes
  - Come running home to her
  - She set a table both long and wide
  - And on it she put bread and wine
  - '"Come eat, come drink my three little babes'
  - Come eat, come drink of mine"
  - '"We want none of your bread, mother'
  - Neither do we want your wine
  - For yonder stands our Savior dear
  - And to Him we must resign"
  - '"Green grass grows over our heads, mother'
  - Cold clay is under our feet
  - And every tear you shed for us
  - It wets our winding-sheet"

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Buell_Kazee:The_Hobo%27s_Last_Ride
  - In the dark city yards of the Santa Fe
  - Stood a freight made up for the east
  - And the engineer, with his oily waste
  - Was grooming the great iron beast
  - Whilst ten cars back in the murky dusk
  - A boxcar door swung wide
  - And a hobo lifted his pal aboard
  - To start on his last long ride
  - As the train wheels clicked on a coupling joint
  - Was a song for the hobo's ears
  - The hobo talked to the still white form
  - His pal for many a year
  - For a mighty long time we've rambled Jack
  - With the luck of men that roam
  - With the backdoor steps for a dining room
  - And a boxcar for a home
  - We dodged the bulls on the Eastern route
  - And the cops on Chessapeake
  - We travelled the Lydgyl Narrow gauge
  - In the days of Cripple-Creek
  - We drifted down from sunny Cal'
  - On the rails of the old SP
  - And of all you had, through good and bad
  - A half always belonged to me
  - You made me promise to you Jack
  - If I lived and you cashed in
  - To take you back to the old churchyard
  - And bury you there with your kin
  - You seemed to know, I would keep my word
  - For you said that I was white
  - Well, I'm keeping my promise to you pal
  - For I'm taking home tonight
  - I hadn't the money to send you there
  - So I'm taking you back on the fly
  - It's the decent way for a bow to go
  - Home to the by and by
  - I knew that fever had you Jack
  - And that Doctor just wouldn't come
  - He was to busy treating wealthy folks
  - To doctor a dying bum
  - As the train sped over the ribbons of steel
  - Straight through to the east it sped
  - The engineer in the high cab seat
  - Kept his eyes on the rails ahead
  - While, ten cars back in the empty box
  - A lonely hobo sighed
  - For days of old, and his pal so cold
  - Who was taking his last long ride

  - In the dawning waking hour he'll lift his head
  - And brush his eyes with gentle strokes
  - That will only blindly mislead him
  - Into the first day of creation
  - Which he can only see in limitation.
  - Now he sits upon his empty bed,
  - His heart is warm, his heart is full and he can see
  - Yet it is impossible for him to retain me
  - For his arms are without form;
  - And he cannot know the word
  - As his mind cries out absurd.
  - Now he's standing inside the doorway,
  - He is afraid but he believes all that he sees
  - On the floor where everything is merging
  - And the pictures he sees are tragic
  - And he begins to believe in magic.
  - Now he lies down in a hole, down in the ground
  - Where it is cold and now he knows
  - Now he realizes his biggest mistake
  - That he never had to grow old
  - And he never had to grow cold and die.

  - That is to say your loving me
  - Would be our only crime

  - In the midst of all this love
  - Many men have loved the bells
  - You fastened to the rain
  - And everyone who wanted you
  - Found what she would always want again
  - And I'd have been the dust for you
  - And I'd have been the grass for you
  - But you tell me with your beauty
  - You can see her duty clearly
  - In the midst of New-York-City
  - In the midst of all my love
  - Your body like a searchlight
  - In the prison of my need
  - Oh I would share your loneliness
  - And I demand your greed
  - And everything depends upon
  - How near you sleep to me
  - And isn't it a pity

  - And then sailed away are truly truly gone

  - Fall through the walls of sand

  - Handsome stride and shoulders wide disguise a heart of stone
  - Lovers' wiles and tender smiles are better left alone
  - With his head hung low and his shoulders down
  - And a tear in the bottom of his shoe
  - He'll beg and tease and vow on his knees,
  - And then betray you, true
  - He'll say I'm tired, I'm broke, I'm sick I love you, while he cries
  - He'll say I'm sorry through his tears and all the time he lies
  - Shudder and sulk when he's at his best

  - It's just a memory of blue.
  - Since my baby left me
  - I can't never win
  - I go down by the river side
  - Think about jumpin' in
  - Really let my heart hang low
  - I can hear me moan
  - Since my baby left me
  - Just can't be alone
  - And it's Blue Sunday
  - Saturday night ain't nothing to me
  - It's just a memory
  - Of blue.

  - Broke-down girl, ragged heart
  - She's seen the sweet and the sad.
  - Fire in love, Liar in love
  - Mommy's little girl gone bad.
  - Broke down baby, Hanzelless Gretel,
  - Heart made of calico stone.
  - Pinocchio rose in princesses' clothes
  - Lonely but never lone.
  - The silver hearts of heroes,
  - How heavy they are.
  - How they were weighing her down.
  - Oh prince Charming, you never came.
  - Her castles fell around her,
  - The mortal men they found her,
  - Found her, found her,
  - As you see her here.
  - A broke-down baby, sad Cinderella,
  - A Disney delusion, a doll.
  - A soulless solace for a sailor shore,
  - A broke-down girl, that's all.

  - Indian legislation's on the desk of a do-right Congressman
  - Now, he don't know much about the issue
  - So he picks up the phone
  - And he asks advice of the Senator out in Indian country
  - A darling of the energy companies
  - Who are ripping off what's left of the reservations
  - I learned a safety rule, I don't know who to thank
  - Don't stand between the reservation and the corporate bank
  - They'll send in federal tanks, it isn't nice but it's reality
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee deep in the earth
  - Cover me with pretty lies
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - They got these energy companies who want the land
  - And theyve got churches by the dozen who want to guide our hands
  - And sign Mother Earth over to pollution, war and greed
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee deep in the earth
  - Cover me with pretty lies
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - We got the federal marshals, we got the covert spies
  - We get the liars by the fire and we got the FBI's
  - They lie in court and get nailed and still Peltier goes off to jail
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee, an aid to the reservation
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee, transferred in sequence
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee, to murder an intimidation
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - My girlfriend Annie Mae talked about Uranium
  - Her head was filled with bullets and her body dumped
  - The FBI cut off her hands and told us she'd died of exposure
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee deep in the earth
  - Cover me with pretty lies
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee, bury my heart at wounded knee
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee, bury my heart at wounded knee
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - We had the Goldrush Wars, why didn't we learn to crawl?
  - And now our history gets written in a liars scrawl
  - They tell ya, Hey honey, you can still be an Indian
  - D-d-down at the Y on Saturday nights
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee deep in the earth
  - Cover me with pretty lies
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee deep in the earth
  - Cover me with pretty lies
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee
  - Bury my heart at wounded knee

  - Each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign
  - He tells the native population that civilization is fine
  - And three educated savages holler from a bamboo tree
  - That civilization is a thing for me to see
  - So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
  - Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
  - Don't want no bright lights, false teeth, doorbells, landlords, I make it clear
  - That no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
  - I looked through a magazine the missionary's wife concealed (Magazine? What happens?)
  - I see how people who are civilized bung you with automobile (You know you can
    get hurt that way Dani
  - At the movies they have got to pay many coconuts to see (What do they see, Darling?)
  - Uncivilized pictures that the newsreel takes of me
  - So bongo, bongo, bongo, he don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
  - Bingo, bangle, bungle, he's so happy in the jungle, he refuse to go
  - Don't want no penthouse, bathtub, streetcars, taxis, noise in my ear
  - So, no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
  - They hurry like savages to get aboard an iron train
  - And though it's smokey and it's crowded, they're too civilized to complain
  - When they've got two weeks vacation, they hurry to vacation ground (What do they
    do, Darling?)
  - They swim and they fish, but that's what I do all year round
  - So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no no no
  - Bingo, bangle, bungle, I'm so happy in the jungle, I refuse to go
  - Don't want no jailhouse, shotgun, fish-hooks, golf clubs, I got my spears
  - So, no matter how they coax him, I'll stay right here
  - They have things like the atom bomb, so I think I'll stay where I am
  - Civilization, I'll stay right here

  - 'And my belly is craving, '
  - I got a shakin' in my head,
  - Feel like I'm dyin' and I wish I was dead.
  - If I lived till tomorrow that'll be a long time,
  - But I'll reel and I'll fall and rise on cod'ine
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.
  - Well, when I was a young girl I learned not to care
  - About whiskey and from it I often did swear.
  - My mother and father said whiskey is a curse,
  - But the fate of their baby is a many times worse,
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.
  - Stay away from the cities, stay away from the towns,
  - Stay away from the men pushin' the cod'ine around.
  - Stay away from the stores where the remedy is fine,
  - For better your pain than be caught on cod'ine,
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.
  - You'll forget you're a woman, you'll forget about men,
  - Try it just once, and you'll try it again.
  - You'll forget about life, you'll forget about time,
  - And you'll live off your days as a slave to cod'ine.
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.
  - But if I die tomorrow, still one thing I've done,
  - I'd heeded the warning that I got when I was young.
  - My one satisfaction it comes when I think
  - That I'm living my life without bendin' to drink
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.
  - And my belly is craving, I got a shaking in my head
  - I feel like I'm dyin' and I wish I was dead.
  - If I live till tomorrow that'll be a long time,
  - For I'll reel and I'll fall and I'll die on cod'ine,
  - And it's real, and it's real, one more time.

  - But it really doesn't matter 'cause their children hear me well
  - And they will dream the dream my Mother sends to them.

  - God is alive; Magic is afoot
  - God is alive; Magic is afoot
  - God is afoot; Magic is alive
  - Alive is afoot.
  - Magic never died.
  - God never sickened;
  - Many poor men lied
  - Many sick men lied
  - Magic never weakened
  - Magic never hid
  - Magic always ruled
  - God is afoot
  - God never died.
  - God was ruler
  - Though his funeral lengthened
  - Though his mourners thickened
  - Magic never fled
  - Though his shrouds were hoisted
  - The naked God did live
  - Though his words were twisted
  - The naked Magic thrived
  - Though his death was published
  - Round and round the world
  - The heart did not believe
  - Many hurt men wondered
  - Many struck men bled
  - Magic never faltered
  - Magic always led.
  - Many stones were rolled
  - But God would not lie down
  - Many wild men lied
  - Many fat men listened
  - Though they offered stones
  - Magic still was fed
  - Though they locked their coffers
  - God was always served.
  - Magic is afoot. God rules.
  - Alive is afoot. Alive is in command.
  - Many weak men hungered
  - Many strong men thrived
  - Though they boasted solitude
  - God was at their side
  - Nor the dreamer in his cell
  - Nor the captain on the hill
  - Magic is alive
  - Though his death was pardoned
  - Round and round the world
  - The heart did not believe.
  - Though laws were carved in marble
  - They could not shelter men
  - Though altars built in parliaments
  - They could not order men
  - Police arrested Magic
  - And Magic went with them,
  - For Magic loves the hungry.
  - But Magic would not tarry
  - It moves from arm to arm
  - It would not stay with them
  - Magic is afoot
  - It cannot come to harm
  - It rests in an empty palm
  - It spawns in an empty mind
  - But Magic is no instrument
  - Magic is the end.
  - Many men drove Magic
  - But Magic stayed behind
  - Many strong men lied
  - They only passed through Magic
  - And out the other side
  - Many weak men lied
  - They came to God in secret
  - And though they left him nourished
  - They would not tell who healed
  - Though mountains danced before them
  - They said that God was dead
  - Though his shrouds were hoisted
  - The naked God did live
  - This I mean to whisper to my mind
  - This I mean to laugh with in my mind
  - This I mean my mind to serve till
  - Service is but Magic
  - Moving through the world
  - And mind itself is Magic
  - Coursing through the flesh
  - And flesh itself is Magic
  - Dancing on a clock
  - And time itself the magic length of God

  - He's a pretty good man if you ask me.
  - Now his job may not be steady
  - With his name upon the door,
  - But a dozen well-fed kids I know
  - Seldom ask for more.
  - He remembers all our birthdays
  - With a hug and something nice,
  - And his lap is the sweetest place we know
  - To make the world seem right.
  - He's lot of fun in a ticklin' fight
  - And when the snow is deep.
  - He can calm a frightened animal
  - Or rock a child to sleep
  - We love him more than tongue can tell
  - And more than song can sing.

  - And he met a girl one day
  - Said "come home with me tonight"
  - '"Oh no!" she cried "I never will." '

  - I never will be found

  - Where I may love you free
  - Beyond the confines of your walls
  - And beyond the sweetest words"
  - '"And beyond the mountains high'
  - Beyond the fields of shame
  - And beyond the prettiest wedding ring
  - For I'd never take your name"
  - '"And wander with me now'
  - Or wander all forlorn
  - But know I love you, tearful one,
  - Much more than I can show"
  - He could not understand
  - He thought she could not care
  - '"Oh, take me far away," she''d cried'
  - And he could not hear her prayer
  - And he wandered off alone
  - To never know her dream
  - And she still dwells within the forest
  - Longing for his love
  - '"So, wander with me now'
  - Or wander off alone

  - Hey, little bird.
  - Perched in the southern sun,
  - Those were the days when your feathers were new,
  - And I remember you.
  - Little bird now you know where you're at,
  - Now the clouds are your habitat,
  - But more than that we meet again and you're still my friend.
  - So, little bird, the times have changed considerably,
  - I am a thrush now and you are a peacock indeed.
  - So flash your colors and I will sing,
  - Glide into time with the moon on your wing,
  - Little bird, little bird, little bird,
  - Like a gull of the sea, your resting place
  - Can be heaven or countless oceans far from me.
  - So, little bird, take my blessings to the stars above you,
  - And scatter my wishes to the ones who love you.
  - Take off often on a trip transcendent,
  - And sink in the waves and then rise resplendent.
  - Fly with your friends in a "V" formation
  - And sing to your flock from your vantage station,
  - Out in the stars beyond hell's dominion,
  - And rest at my feet in between migration,
  - Little bird, I remember you.
  - Hey, little bird, I remember you.

  - So just clean out all your ears, these are my views and you will find
  - Man,
  - It's been a minute since it's been this nice out
  - Blue skies out, no clouds, something to write down
  - I'll have to go home soon and try to pay the bills
  - If I had a nickel every time they called I'd make a mill
  - But such is life, and as much as I'd like it
  - To be different, hard work is how you make your luck in life, right?
  - For now I sit here, sip beer, and contemplate
  - Maybe fiending for a smoke, I'm hoping he can concentrate
  - Out in the sun I think of everything I've done wrong
  - Find I can't fit it all in one song, so
  - For every half truth and every broken promise
  - Please, accept these words I wrote in open honesty
  - I apologize for every choice I might have made
  - To hurt your feelings or your health, to ever bother someone else
  - Your style of living is your choice, and we all want a different kind
  - So, please, love all your faults
  - I do the same with ones we find cause -

  - That one of these days, I'd wake up, get up and go away
  - Well I've got my rent on my mind, worry most of the time
  - While wasting never spent hell-bent on the grind
  - Down the wishing well fell the odd center a dime
  - But only, seven percent of it supposed to be mine
  - I'm getting, kinda fed up with trying to get ahead
  - That's why - 9 out of 10 times I'm liable to be lying in bed
  - Instead of living life like I'm dead
  - No longer sit in the prison inside my head
  - I'm starting to come to my senses and
  - No longer be so defensive and
  - Though sometimes seems so senseless
  - I get back up and go
  - I've been up, I've been down
  - I've been lucky enough to find my higher ground
  - In all my days, I've hoped and prayed
  - That one of these days I'd just wake up, get up and go away
  - This song is like a counseling session (whoosah)
  - I need to channel my aggression (whoosah)
  - I need to handle my profession
  - I'm the planet's biggest panic stricken manic-depressant
  - Questioning myself as I'm sitting right and looking back
  - Drinking Jack, Heinekens, in both hands, crooked hat
  - Mr. small complex smoking a cigarette
  - Like you don't know me, what the fuck you think you're looking at
  - Why is the fire in my eyes like I'm evil
  - It's just I'm always suspicious of new people
  - Self-centered lieutenant, I'm a well balanced soldier
  - A lie with a strategist's chip on both shoulders
  - Push the bullshit out of my life, keep biting
  - Spiritual enlightenment, price this excitement
  - Build strength within, I'm trying to find space
  - Freedom of choice, but trying for blind faith
  - I've been up, I've been down

  - Captain Collier came home, he's been fighting the war
  - And I guess he thought he'd be hailed as a hero and more
  - And he walked down the streets of the old home town
  - And he saw how it is around here now
  - Now Captain Collier had to call
  - Far too many girls for a date that night
  - All the girls had gone out
  - With their long haired boys. Captain Collier, he cried
  - '"What the hell have I been fighting for?"'
  - Oh, Captain it's for you
  - We wanna bring you home
  - We wanna hold you in our arms
  - Come back and keep us warm.
  - P.F.C. Mannie Stein,
  - Had been drafted and gone
  - He'd been told that only cowards say no.
  - He came home and called some old friends,
  - They'd resisted the draft
  - And they both were in prison
  - And their wives and their kids
  - Were all skinny and having a bad time
  - And P.F.C Stein
  - He remembered the men
  - Called political prisoners you know where and when.
  - And he learned that the lines are tapped all the time now
  - And he's wondering if maybe his courage is needed at home now
  - Yes soldier we're afraid
  - We're not just bein' fools

  - Corp'ral Thomas McCann

  - And a dungaree girl told him he'd been a man all along
  - And he looked at the sign that she carried in her hand.
  - It said "Fuck the war and bring our brothers home"
  - And corp'ral McCann he looks into her eyes
  - And I believe that he's begun to understand
  - Oh soldier, It's for you
  - We formed our little bands
  - The politicians and the magazines
  - They just don't understand.
  - Yes, soldier it's for you
  - We're riskin' all we have

  - Now that your big eyes have finally opened
  - Now that you're wondering how must they feel
  - Meaning them that you've chased across America's movie screens
  - Now that you're wondering "how can it be real?"
  - That the ones you've called colourful, noble and proud
  - In your school propaganda
  - They starve in their splendor?
  - You've asked for my comment I simply will render
  - My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
  - Now that the longhouses breed superstition
  - You force us to send our toddlers away
  - To your schools where they're taught to despise their traditions.
  - Forbid them their languages, then further say
  - That American history really began
  - When Columbus set sail out of Europe, then stress
  - That the nation of leeches that conquered this land
  - Are the biggest and bravest and boldest and best.
  - And yet where in your history books is the tale
  - Of the genocide basic to this country's birth,
  - Of the preachers who lied, how the Bill of Rights failed,
  - How a nation of patriots returned to their earth?
  - And where will it tell of the Liberty Bell
  - 'As it rang with a thud '
  - O'er Kinzua mud
  - And of brave Uncle Sam in Alaska this year?
  - My country 'tis of thy people you're dying
  - 'Hear how the bargain was made for the West:'
  - With her shivering children in zero degrees,
  - Blankets for your land, so the treaties attest,
  - Oh well, blankets for land is a bargain indeed,
  - And the blankets were those Uncle Sam had collected
  - From smallpox-diseased dying soldiers that day.
  - And the tribes were wiped out and the history books censored,
  - A hundred years of your statesmen have felt it's better this way.
  - And yet a few of the conquered have somehow survived,
  - Their blood runs the redder though genes have paled.
  - From the Grand Canyon's caverns to craven sad hills
  - The wounded, the losers, the robbed sing their tale.
  - From Los Angeles County to upstate New York
  - The white nation fattens while others grow lean;
  - Oh the tricked and evicted they know what I mean.
  - My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
  - The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens;
  - Our life blood shut up in your chemical tanks.
  - And now here you come, bill of sale in your hands
  - And surprise in your eyes that we're lacking in thanks
  - For the blessings of civilization you've brought us,
  - 'The lessons you''ve taught us, the ruin you''ve wrought us '
  - Oh see what our trust in America's brought us.
  - My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
  - Now that the pride of the sires receives charity,
  - Now that we're harmless and safe behind laws,
  - Now that my life's to be known as yourheritage,
  - Now that even the graves have been robbed,
  - 'Now that our own chosen way is a novelty '
  - Hands on our hearts we salute you your victory,
  - Choke on your blue white and scarlet hypocrisy
  - Pitying the blindness that you've never seen
  - That the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory
  - They were never no more than carrion crows,
  - Pushed the wrens from their nest, stole their eggs, changed their story;
  - The mockingbird sings it, it's all that he knows.
  - '"Ah what can I do?" say a powerless few'
  - With a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye
  - Can't you see that their poverty's profiting you.
  - My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.

  - I'm a rambler and a rover and a wanderer it seems
  - I've travelled all over chasing after my dreams
  - But a dream should come true and a heart should be filled
  - And a life should be lived in the Piney Wood Hills
  - I'll return to the woodlands, I'll return to the snow
  - I'll return to the hills, and the valley below
  - I'll return as a poor man or a king if God wills
  - But I'm on my way home to the Piney Wood Hills
  - I was raised on a song there
  - I done right, I done wrong there
  - And it's true I belong there
  - And it's true it's my home
  - From ocean to ocean I've rambled and roamed
  - And soon I'll return to my Piney Wood home
  - Maybe someday I'll find someone who will
  - Love as I love my Piney Wood Hills
  - I was raised on a song there
  - I done right, I done wrong there
  - And it's true I belong there
  - And it's true it's my home
  - I'll return to the woodlands, I'll return to the snow
  - I'll return to the hills and the valley below
  - I'll return as a poor man or a king if God wills
  - But I'm on my way home to the Piney Wood Hills

  - I tippy-toe across your dream each night
  - So as not to wake you
  - Asleep in your summer
  - A garland of flowers
  - Yellow and white around your waist
  - While I walk these paths of ice
  - 'Ice my breast '
  - And strings of ice my hair
  - My hands two hooks of steel
  - Ice nose, snow eyes
  - Frozen open mouth
  - Flakes of snow your bridal veils
  - I come down the soft white path
  - Bouquets of poppies
  - Spilling from my heart

  - GMO GMO has got to go
  - Power in the blood Power in the blood
  - No time for spin-doctors' medicine
  - Corporation government selling me some cover-up
  - Weaponizing pesticides; poison in my groceries
  - Nothing but another drug, a license they can buy and sell
  - I don't mind dying
  - Well I don't mind dying
  - I don't mind dying
  - But when that call it comes I will say no no no to war
  - No time for backhanded compliments
  - From television anchor men desperate for an incident
  - Real estate assassins exploiting our predicament
  - Everything depends upon it being in their interests
  - No I don't mind dying
  - I don't mind dying
  - I don't mind dying
  - When that call it comes, I will say no no no to war
  - There is power in the blood, justice in the soul
  - When that call it comes, I will say no no no to war
  - Power in the blood, justice in the soul
  - When that call it comes I will say no no no to war
  - There's military interest, GMOs in paradise
  - Bio-weapons high up on the call sheet
  - Young soldiers driving tanks
  - But old thieves they drive the banks
  - And you never see a uniform on Wall Street
  - There is power in the blood
  - I don't mind dying
  - I don't mind the dying
  - I don't mind dying
  - When that call it comes I will say no no no to war

  - Uranium poisoning kills
  - We're starving in a handful of gluttons
  - We're drowning in their gravy spills
  - Their tongues are silver forks
  - There's a lack of wisdom,
  - You can hear it on their breath
  - Windego
  - It's delicate confronting these priests of the golden bull
  - They preach from the pulpit of the bottom line
  - Their minds rustle with million dollar bills
  - You say Silver burns a hole in your pocket
  - And Gold burns a hole in your soul
  - Well, uranium burns a hole in forever
  - It just gets out of control
  - There was a crooked man who walked a crooked mile
  - He raised a crooked sixpence to hide a crooked style
  - He won a crooked vote and smiled a crooked smile

  - Their tongues are silver forks

  - Shall I tell you of the night
  - It was long ago
  - Late November and the snow
  - Just about to fall
  - And the moon was big and bright
  - Cold and sharp and clear
  - And the air was biting
  - Softly, swiftly down the road
  - Never made a sound
  - Someone came from far away
  - Someone tall and old
  - As I looked into his eyes
  - No reflections came
  - And I gave him bedding
  - Oh, my little rosary
  - How I miss you so
  - Never used you very well
  - Now, I never will
  - I am farther from you now
  - Than the two ends of eternity
  - Now, I do his bidding

  - She's lying down there there on the floor
  - Not exactly what you waited for
  - There once was a woman who took you by the hand
  - And showed you you could be a man
  - But now there's nothing left to say
  - And I'd be grateful if you'd just go away.
  - In her jewerly box
  - She still keeps your high school ring
  - And I know you'll remember
  - Her last virgin spring.

  - He couldn't take no more abuse

  - You can't talk to a man

  - And surround the border.
  - Now, from his bulldog mouth,
  - As he led the posse south,
  - Came the cry, "We got to ride
  - To clean up the streets
  - For our wives and our daughters!"
  - You can't talk to a man
  - When he don't wanna understand.
  - No, no, no, no, no.

  - Wasn't in the papers,
  - But you know, they hanged ol' Smack right then
  - Instead of later.

  - Sometimes I recall what others have said:-
  - Love is for lovers in love and full grown,
  - Life's for the living and death's for the dead,
  - And the depth of a heart is a fathom unknown.
  - Sometimes when I get to thinking about you,
  - And all the things that we've never said
  - To each other, it seems such a shame to go blue
  - When there's so many years to lie silent and dead.
  - I know, you know, all about life.
  - You know, I know, nothing at all.
  - Still why should I know daily strife
  - When the touch of your hand makes me glad I'm so small.
  - Time brings us trouble as days come and go.
  - I know, you know I'll understand.
  - Could you, would you suffer a woe,
  - When a blink of your eye and I'm at your command.
  - Think of the years before we were a pair,
  - Years lived apart we spent learning to farm.
  - Sowing, growing and learning to care
  - For ourselves, and preparing for each other's arms.
  - Love is a flower, blooms when we're too young;
  - Pluck it, it's gone, tended it grows.
  - We've been tending since the first sprout was sprung -
  - To the most patient farmer, the best harvest goes.
  - Sometimes I recall what others have said:-
  - Love is for lovers in love and full grown,
  - Life's for the living and death's for the dead,
  - And the depth of a heart is a fathom unknown.

  - On their store window trees
  - My dreams with the seagulls fly
  - Out of reach out of cry
  - Out of the city
  - And down to the seaside
  - To sun on my shoulders
  - And wind in my hair
  - But sandcastles crumble
  - And hunger is human
  - And humans are hungry
  - For worlds they can't share
  - My dreams with the seagulls fly
  - Out of reach out of cry

  - Who dives to the waters
  - And catches his silver-fine
  - Dinner alone
  - Crying where are the footprints

  - And the hands that cast wishes

  - Thy night time sky
  - Our hopes that fly
  - Undimmed by human tears

  - God shed His grace on thee

  - The banner of the free
  - And crown thy good with brotherhood
  - From sea to shining sea

  - My world is like a river
  - It's a dark as it is deep
  - Night after night the past slips in
  - Gathers all my sleep
  - My days are just an endless stream
  - Of emptiness to me
  - Filled only by the fleeting moments of his memory
  - Sweet memories
  - Sweet memories
  - Ummm
  - He slipped into the silence
  - Of my dreams last night
  - Wandering from room to room
  - He's turnin' on each light
  - His laughter spills like water, water
  - From the river to the sea
  - I'm swept away from sadness
  - Clingin' to his memory
  - Sweet memory
  - Sweet memory

  - Tall trees in Georgia. They grow so high, they shade me so.
  - I'm sadly walking through the thicket I go.
  - The sweetest love I ever had I left aside
  - Because I did not want to be any man's bride.
  - My parents took me where ever I traveled out.
  - I traveled west and north and east and south.
  - When I grew older and married I would be,
  - I found my sweetheart, he would not marry me.
  - When I was younger the boys a-courtin' came around
  - But now I'm older and they're all settled down.
  - Young girls take warning and don't complain
  - And 'don't make moan,
  - For if you're fickle you'll soon be left alone.
  - Control your mind, my girl, and give your heart to one,
  - For if you love all men you'll sure be left with none.
  - And if perfection were to be found in mortal men
  - We'd soon grow tired and go off alone again.
  - Tall trees in Georgia. They grow so high, they shade me so.
  - I'm sadly walking through the thicket I go.

  - Let go the tempting memory of the pain.
  - Give up the vows you've taken
  - And you will live, and you will learn to fly away,
  - And you will fly.
  - And you will live my love
  - And see the stars regain your starless night
  - And you will find your sun
  - And learn the magic meaning of it's light
  - All souls will be yours to cherish
  - Rising, falling, in their earthly flight
  - And you will fly
  - And I would love my love
  - And he would seek a refuge in my eyes
  - But no resource of love,
  - Could keep him from the fire where loving dies
  - And I would reach out my hand as he was
  - Falling, falling to his home on high
  - And he would fly
  - Give up your treasured wounds,
  - Let go the tempting memory of the pain
  - Give up the vows you've taken

  - Playing music on the Beauty Way
  - He's gonna die with some money in his pocket
  - Wish I could do the same today little darling
  - Wish I could do the same today
  - Doe eyed kid and a little transistor
  - Tuned into Wolfman jack
  - I picked up a guitar heard the sirens whisper
  - And I never looked back little darling
  - And I never looked back
  - I worked the clubs along the Sangre de Cristos?
  - Polished the diamond in the rough
  - By the time I hit L.A. I was hotter than a pistol
  - But you're never hot enough little darling
  - You never really hot enough
  - I felt the lights on the big, big stages
  - The fire burning in my soul
  - I've had those nights when my guitar rages
  - But it's not something you control little darling

  - Up on a pedestal, nowhere to hide,

  - Little girls who wish too much,
  - To be loved when they grow up,
  - Watch me 'round and 'round.
  - Merry-go-rounds they are merry for those
  - Who are free to come and go;
  - I'm bolted down to the merriment show,
  - Watch me 'round and 'round.
  - My prayers were answered the same way I'd planned.
  - I got my status there's nowhere to stand;
  - I've got my wings, now there's nowhere to land,
  - Watch me 'round and 'round.
  - Wished I may, and wished I might,
  - 'Wished my fun could last all night:'
  - Chains of tinsel caught me tight,
  - Watch me 'round and 'round.

  - Yesterday a child came out to wonder
  - Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
  - Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
  - And tearful at the falling of a star
  - Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
  - Skated over ten clear frozen streams
  - Words like, when you're older, must appease him
  - And promises of someday make his dreams
  - And the seasons they go round and round
  - And the painted ponies go up and down
  - We're captive on the carousel of time
  - We can't return we can only look behind
  - From where we came
  - And go round and round and round
  - In the circle game
  - Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
  - Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
  - And they tell him,
  - Take your time, it won't be long now
  - Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
  - And the seasons they go round and round
  - And the painted ponies go up and down
  - We're captive on the carousel of time
  - We can't return we can only look behind
  - From where we came
  - And go round and round and round
  - In the circle game
  - So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
  - Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
  - There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
  - Before the last revolving year is through
  - And the seasons they go round and round
  - And the painted ponies go up and down
  - We're captive on the carousel of time
  - We can't return, we can only look behind
  - From where we came
  - And go round and round and round

  - That's she's been betrayed by her own dear brother
  - That he has chosen another fair hand
  - Many young man had a song of her beauty

  - Of her father's youngest, fairest son
  - Tell to me no lies
  - Tell to me no stories
  - But saddle my good horse and I'll go and see my own true love
  - If your words be true ones, then that will mean the end of me
  - Brother oh brother what lies be these ones
  - They say your love to another I lose
  - There's a child within me of thy very own lineage
  - And I know it's I that thou would chose
  - And have you yet told your father or mother
  - All that thou has told here to me
  - And he's taken off his good braided sword
  - And I am down beside his knee
  - No I've not told no one but you my dear one
  - For it's a secret between us two
  - And I would come home and quit all my roaming
  - And spend my days only waiting on you
  - Too late too late for change my sister
  - My father has chosen another fair bride
  - And he stabbed her easy and lovingly lay her
  - Down in her grave by the green wood side

  - Down by the clear river I rollicked along.
  - I heard an old man making sad lamentation;
  - He was rocking the cradle and the child not his own.
  - 'Cho: Hi ho, hi ho, my laddie lie aisy'
  - For perhaps your own daddy might never be known.
  - I'm sitting and sighing and rocking the cradle,
  - And nursin' the baby that's none of my own.
  - When first that I married your inconstant mother
  - I thought myself lucky to be blessed with a wife.
  - But for my misfortune, sure I was mistaken
  - She's proved both a curse and a plague on my life.
  - She goes out every night to a ball or a party
  - And leaves me here rockin' he cradle alone.
  - The innocent laddie he calls me his daddy
  - But little he knows that he's none of my own.
  - Now come all ye young men that's inclined to get married
  - Take my advice and let the women alone.
  - For by the Lord Harry, if ever you marry
  - They'll leave you with a baby that's none of your own.

  - A reckless world out of control
  - And he's the one supposed to tame it
  - A restless heart out on patrol
  - He was in love but he couldn't name it
  - And Baby comes to lay his heart down
  - When his tough is wearing thin
  - When the world has had enough of him
  - He knows just what I'll say
  - Too much is never enough
  - When it comes to loving you
  - You'll see
  - Too much is never enough
  - I'll be there
  - All the way to where forever goes
  - Our world just suddenly went so dark
  - Whatever was there, we couldn't read it
  - I saw his dreams go up in smoke
  - He only said, "I just don't need it"
  - And then he held me to his heart
  - Although his world was falling down
  - He dried my tears and he held me close
  - And he said, "We'll make it Baby"
  - Too much is never enough
  - When it comes to loving you
  - You'll see
  - Too much is never enough
  - I'll be there
  - All the way to where forever goes

  - One with hair of golden,
  - One with skin as deep as autumn burning leaves.
  - One with eyes of ocean color,
  - And ocean deep as ocean eyes can be.
  - Look for him at sunrise,
  - When the sunrise rainbows puddle every scarlet bay.
  - And if he's there,
  - Surfing crystal mountains,
  - Say hello for me.
  - One with hands of sinew,
  - Hands as wired to perfection as a jeweler man's.
  - One with days of childhood in his days,
  - And childhood in his ways of being a man.
  - Look for him at noonday,
  - When the noonday poppies sweetly nod their sweet perfumes.
  - And if he's there,
  - Don't wake him up just pass on by,
  - And wish him perfect dreams.
  - One with flowers in his eyes,
  - And flowers in his dreams of flowers running wild.
  - One with stars in every smile,
  - Who smiles at every star and every waterfall.
  - Look for him at sunset,
  - When the sunset waves are breaking at infinity.
  - And if he's there,
  - Surfing crystal mountains,
  - Say hello for me.
  - And if he's there,
  - A silhouette against the green,
  - Tell him hello for me.

  - A little boy with midnight in his hair
  - And promise in his eyes of days and nights still yet to be
  - Days and nights he'd cling to me
  - For I am winter's lady and he is winter's child
  - Though there be summers yet
  - And the smell of pine comes crying to my heart
  - Still my joy and my security will lie beside the boy of less impurity

  - Diamonds made of trust and love for me

  - Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
  - Sailed off in a wooden shoe,
  - Sailed on a river of crystal light,
  - Into a sea of dew.
  - '"Where are you going, and what do you wish?"'
  - The old moon asked the three.
  - '"We have come to fish for the herring fish'
  - That live in this beautiful sea;
  - Nets of silver and gold have we!"
  - Said Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.
  - The old moon laughed and sang a song,
  - As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
  - And the wind that sped them all night long
  - Ruffled the waves of dew.
  - The little stars were the herring fish
  - That lived in that beautiful sea--
  - '"Now cast your nets wherever you wish,'
  - Never afeard are we";
  - 'So cried the stars to the fishermen three:'
  - Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.
  - All night long their nets they threw
  - To the stars in the twinkling foam,
  - Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
  - Bringing the fishermen home;
  - '''T was all so pretty a sail it seemed'
  - As if it could not be,
  - And some folks thought 't was a dream they'd dreamed
  - Of sailing that beautiful sea,
  - 'But I shall name you the fishermen three:'
  - Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.
  - Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
  - And Nod is a little head,
  - And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
  - Is a wee one's trundle-bed.
  - So shut your eyes while mother sings
  - Of wonderful sights that be,
  - And you shall see the beautiful things
  - As you rock in the misty sea,
  - 'Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:'
  - Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.

  - This is song Atlanta Special, here
  - Runnin' all down through Georgia
  - All down through the south
  - An all through the Gulf of Mexico
  - When I was a little boy
  - I was startin' to catchin' this train
  - And I never forget, I fifteen years old.
  - I hear'd that train that mo'nin
  - That 8:45 was hittin' that rail
  - I had my mule goin' to the field
  - To do some plowin' for my old grandfather.
  - But when this train was comin' down the line
  - She picked up wit' it.
  - (Guitar - comin' down the line)
  - I say, 'Whoa!'
  - My mule stopped
  - I 'cide to leave, I'd try the world
  - I eased on out there
  - And I caught the old freight train
  - That went on down
  - All down through Gulf of Mexico
  - And ev'rywhere else.
  - Oh, I got to thinkin' about Atlanta, Georgia.
  - I say, 'I b'lieve I go back where my
  - Old grandmother live at.'
  - Oh, one night I was sittin' down
  - Boilin' some corn down on the railroad track.
  - I thought about what my old grandmother
  - Told me years ago.
  - 'Said son:'
  - '''You got to reap what you sew.'
  - If you don't be a good boy, you gon'
  - Have bad luck.'
  - I made me a record
  - (They'll buys it)
  - (This way Atlanta, Georgia)
  - 'This song:'
  - 'Sings:'
  - I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, left my home
  - Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!
  - When I fell back in Atlanta, Georgia
  - Old lady lived, last name Miss Ester.
  - She said, 'Son, I heard one of your records
  - About Atlanta, Georgia.
  - Said, 'Can you play it, now?'
  - I reached back in my guitar case
  - And pulled m'old raggedy guitar out.
  - So glad to get back home
  - I commenced to playin' this song for Aunt Ester.
  - 'Sings:'
  - Lord, oh Lord, Lord, Lord!
  - So glad I headed back home
  - Old lady starts at me, did I want anything to eat?
  - I was sittin' there lookin' out toward the railroad
  - Track. I never will forget it, she brought me ham
  - An egg, an toasted cheese an hot cup-a-coffee.
  - When that straight line ten mile a-goin' to
  - I dropped my head an I dropped my food.
  - I said, 'Now, I got to ride this train back'.
  - She said, 'Son, what is wrong?'
  - I said, 'Well, Aunt Ester.'
  - I said, 'Booker got to go.'
  - That train was turnin' tight that mo'nin.
  - (Guitar- turnin' tight)
  - Aunt Ester ask-ed
  - '''Would I know that train if I could hear it?'''
  - She said, 'You're too young, you don't
  - Know nothin' too much about hoboin'.
  - I said, 'Well, I tell ya Aunt Ester, if I can
  - Hear the bell on this train I could tell you
  - Mo' about it.'
  - When that train jumped to the fifteen mile
  - 'Curve, a bell will give you a toll like this:'
  - (Guitar- bell tolling)
  - Made me thought about when my baby
  - Got sick 'n' she died. She's, they called me up.
  - When she run in her fifteen mile curve
  - She throw'd on the airbrake for la't ten mile.
  - (Guitar - airbraking)
  - So, Aunt E. stops me.
  - She says, 'Where you was born at?'
  - I said, 'Atlanta, Georgia'
  - She said, 'That why you can play that ol' guitar, can't cha!'
  - While we was talkin' she heard that train comin'
  - Into that fifteen mile curve.
  - Two old ladies was on that train, cryin' an supperin'
  - Pullin' down the blind. A man give him a signal
  - From the engine to the coach to slow down.
  - You could hear him chokin' that train 'specially down
  - 'Comin'' through Lou''siana like this:'
  - (Guitar - chokin' train)
  - When the man throw'd that red light on
  - Him sho' know it come, that fifteen mile curve.
  - I ease on off back to the station
  - I tol' Aunt E stop, thank her for her food.
  - She said, 'Son, don't forget what your
  - Mother, now, used to told you
  - Now, she said, Take life easy.'
  - I jumped on out there and got in the blind.
  - That train jumped on outta town.
  - (I was steady jumpin' down)
  - (Hauled through Georgia, Lou'siana)
  - Right on down to a place he called
  - Port Teht (?)
  - (That's in Lou'siana)
  - (They was strippin' sorghum

  - '''I''ll hitch up my buggy and saddle my black mare'''
  - An I used to pick cotton an come around
  - In Clarksdale after them cafes, eatin' cheese
  - An cracker.
  - None of the other boys they didn't have an idea
  - What I was thinkin'.
  - I say, I wants to come to be a great man like
  - Charlie Patton, but I didn't want to get killed
  - He did, the way he got killed, the way he had to go.
  - I've always realized I knew I had to die but I didn't
  - Want one of those ol' sand-foot woman, womens to
  - Come up and cut my throat or do somethin' to me
  - That was unnecessary.
  - And so goes on down and got me old piece a-guitar.
  - And I always wanted to play about
  - '''Hitch up my buggy, saddle up my black mare'''
  - '''I wanna find my baby in this great big world, somewhere.'''
  - And I got chance before he was passed.
  - So, he wasn't even thinkin' about passing.
  - And I shaked his hand once, his brother in Clarksdale
  - Have a brother that work at The Compress.
  - And I said, if I ever lived to get half way grown
  - Or grown, I would wanna be just like Charlie Patton was.
  - An after I heard about his death
  - After I got might near grown
  - I would have liked at that time
  - To met the one that caused
  - Him to have that dead. 'Cause he was a great boy.
  - And ah, he used to play-a, a number by
  - '''Old blue jumped the rabbit and they runnin'' one sold mile'''
  - '''When the rabbit fell dead, he cried just like a child''.'
  - And you know I felt so good over that I quit eatin' rabbit.
  - '''Cause them rabbit you know do holler when the dog'
  - Catch up to 'em. He could bit in a newborn baby
  - And they was screamin' and cry'nin'.
  - And ah, after I hear, Charlie Patton went on
  - An play that number, I 'cide I just stop eat rabbit
  - If had my dog catch 'em and I take away from 'em.
  - And so as I went on to say, you know Clarksdale
  - Is a little old small town that-a-way.
  - A lot of good boys been in there.
  - But in traveling through them little small town
  - Like that, a good thing I found a good man can do
  - Is take it easy and take his time and don't fool with
  - Things that you don't have. Ah, that's not worthwhile.
  - You don't have time even, to fool around with.
  - Just take life easy.
  - '''Cause ev''rything shine like gold'
  - And gold you know, they's a lot of brass
  - You know, shine like gold.
  - And so Charlie Patton used to sing that song about
  - '''Hitch up my buggy and saddle up my black mare'''
  - And I hear, would just knock me off my feet.
  - I was bare-feeted, little bare-feeted boy, too.
  - And I like it so well after I growed up, the first
  - Record I put out when I was comin' up about
  - '''Downtown women sickin'' them dogs on me''.'
  - I was one that kind-a compare with it.
  - Ah, I think I made a pretty good hit on that!
  - But now, I done forgot I don't play it so much.
  - But at that time he was goin' so good, you know?
  - And ah, if he's got any friends or relative
  - His mother or father wherever might be
  - To hear me sayin' that I just wanna let 'em know
  - 'That:'
  - '''Old remember, never do be forgotten''.'
  - Things that then went on, you know.
  - So, I gratulates to it.
  - To all his friends, his cousins, to ev'rything.
  - I tried to be the second behind old Big Charlie Patton.
  - He really did.
  - And to tell you the truth
  - The first drank of whiskey that I ever dranken
  - Charlie Patton give me a little in a spoon.
  - He said, 'You're too young to drink too much whiskey'
  - But I'm 'onna give you enough to know what it's about.
  - And I still think about that.
  - I wish I'd aks him to gimme the spoon.
  - And so, while we're here
  - I rather thinkin' of old time thing like that
  - We've got to take thing 'un of consideration.
  - You know thing like that
  - Suppose to bring a man mind back.
  - If you're goin' too fast
  - You're suppose to take a consideration
  - An settle down, and think about.
  - '''Cause that''s your best you can hardly get over.'
  - I just wish the day I could shake Charlie Patton hand.

  - I hear you call my name night and day
  - I heard you call my name in San Diego
  - You called a little louder in L. A.

  - In the waters of old San Francisco bay
  - I heard you say you loved me in Madesco
  - Though I now that you're 3000 miles away
  - I thought that leaving you
  - Was the only thing to do
  - But I hear you call my name night and day
  - Call my name (Call my name)

  - I hear you call my name night and day
  - I heard you say you missed me in Baloxie
  - And I saw your face in Huston in a crowd
  - You begged me to come back in Montgomery
  - And I thought was I to hasty or to proud
  - I thought I heard you weeping in Atlanta
  - And I cried all the way to Jacksonville
  - There's just one thing to do
  - I'm a-coming back to you
  - I love you and I know I always will
  - Call my name (Call my name)

  - I ain't got to worry and I ain't got to care
  - I'm a hundred and twenty miles from nowhere
  - My ornery woman, she just nag me to death

  - The bank's got the Cadillac and Dyna-flow
  - They'll reposses it all, 'cause I ain't there
  - I'm a hundred and twenty miles from nowhere
  - Now if the creditors are breathing down your neck
  - And keeping up with the Joneses is making you a wreck

  - One evening as the sun went down
  - And the jungle fires were burning
  - Down the track came a hobo hiking
  - And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
  - I'm headed for a land that's far away
  - Besides the crystal fountains
  - So come with me, we'll go and see
  - The Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - There's a land that's fair and bright
  - Where the handouts grow on bushes
  - And you sleep out every night
  - Where the boxcars all are empty
  - And the sun shines every day
  - And the birds and the bees
  - And the cigarette trees
  - The lemonade springs
  - Where the bluebird sings
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - All the cops have wooden legs
  - And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
  - And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
  - The farmers' trees are full of fruit
  - And the barns are full of hay
  - Oh I'm bound to go
  - Where there ain't no snow
  - Where the rain don't fall
  - The winds don't blow
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - You never change your socks
  - And the little streams of alcohol
  - Come trickling down the rocks
  - The brakemen have to tip their hats
  - And the railway bulls are blind
  - There's a lake of stew
  - And of whiskey too
  - You can paddle all around it
  - In a big canoe
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - The jails are made of tin
  - And you can walk right out again
  - As soon as you are in
  - There ain't no short-handled shovels
  - No axes, saws nor picks
  - I'm bound to stay
  - Where you sleep all day
  - Where they hung the jerk
  - That invented work
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
  - I'll see you all this coming fall
  - In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

  - Bongo lived near the yellow sun.
  - Bongo beat on a bamboo drum.
  - The bamboo drum went rum tum tum!

  - Lions leaped in the yellow sun.
  - Elephants danced among the plants.
  - When the bamboo drum went rum tum tum
  - Life was grand in the Belgian Congo.
  - Life was gay and full of fun.
  - 'Till one day in the month of may, '
  - A big baboon ate bongo's drum!
  - Poor little bongo
  - Pity little bongo
  - Bongo lost his drum!
  - Bongo wept and bongo cried.
  - Cried because he lost his drum.
  - Elephants, lions, and monkeys said "Big baboon what have you done"
  - 'Big baboon then hung his head "I eat bongo''s drum" He said '
  - '"But tell bongo not to cry, I will be his drum instead"'

  - Bongo beat a merry tune,
  - Beat a tune on the big baboon
  - The big baboon went boom boom boom!
  - Happy little bongo.
  - Lucky little bongo.
  - Bongo found his drum!
  - Monkeys tangoed thought the treetops.
  - Lions leaped beneath the moon.
  - 'Elephants danced among the plants. '

  - And I broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote
  - Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again

  - They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
  - Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann
  - The weeks have gone by, not a word have I heard since then
  - In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
  - I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again
  - My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann
  - Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
  - We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
  - They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
  - Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann
  - My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away
  - If I could have seen her, I know she'd be living today
  - For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
  - Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone

  - There's something strange in the old corral
  - There's a breeze, though the wind has died
  - Though I'm alone in the old corral
  - Seems there is someone at my side
  - Empty saddles in the old corral
  - Where do you ride tonight?
  - Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
  - Are you on the trail of buffalo?
  - Empty saddles in the old corral
  - Where do you ride tonight?
  - Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
  - Are you headin' for the Alamo?
  - Empty guns covered with rust
  - Where do you talk tonight?
  - Empty boots covered with dust
  - Where do you walk tonight?
  - Empty saddles in the old corral
  - My tears will be dried tonight
  - If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
  - Empty saddles in the old corral
  - There is no smoke, still the fires burn
  - There's no song, still I hear guitars
  - There is no dust, still the ghosts return
  - Softly to vanish through the bars

  - Any wealth or fame
  - And he told me You were so awfully good
  - And then he made me cry
  - He said, they nailed You to a cross
  - They wanted You to die
  - And then he made me happy
  - When he said, You came back again
  - Daddy said, Christmas is what we celebrate

  - Then today in the mail I received this short little note
  - And I broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote
  - Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
  - We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
  - They know that she loves me, but poor boys don't fit in their plan
  - Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann
  - The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
  - In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
  - I can't eat, I can't sleep for over and over again
  - My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann
  - Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
  - We're leaving for Europe next week, she'll be busy till then
  - They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plan
  - Good-bye true love, good-bye my sweet Mary Ann
  - My Mary Ann died, they said she just wasted away
  - If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
  - For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
  - Today she'd be wearing my ring, not a blanket of stone

  - When the sun in the morning peeps over the hill
  - And kisses the roses 'round my window sill
  - Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the trill
  - Of the birds in the treetops on Mockingbird Hill
  - Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
  - It gives me a thrill
  - To wake up in the morning
  - To the mockingbird's trill
  - Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee
  - There's peace and good will
  - You're welcome as the flowers
  - On Mockingbird Hill
  - Got a three-cornered plow and an acre to till
  - And a mule that I bought for a ten-dollar bill
  - There's a tumble-down shack and a rusty old mill
  - But it's my Home Sweet Home up on Mockingbird Hill
  - Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
  - It gives me a thrill
  - To wake up in the morning
  - To the mockingbird's trill
  - Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee
  - There's peace and good will
  - You're welcome as the flowers
  - On Mockingbird Hill
  - When it's late in the evening I climb up the hill
  - And survey all my kingdom while everything's still
  - Only me and the sky and an old whippoorwill
  - Singin' songs in the twilight on Mockingbird Hill
  - Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
  - It gives me a thrill
  - To wake up in the morning
  - To the mockingbird's trill
  - Tra la la tweedle dee dee dee

  - In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
  - There once lived a maiden called Molly Malone
  - She wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets wide and narrow
  - Singing cockles fresh mussels alive a-live O!
  - A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
  - A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
  - She wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets wide and narrow
  - Singing cockles fresh mussels alive a-live O!
  - She was a fishmonger and sure it is no wonder
  - For so were her father and mother before
  - They wheeled their wheel barrows through streets wide and narrow
  - Singing cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
  - A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
  - A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
  - They wheeled their wheel barrows through streets broad and narrow
  - Singing cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
  - She then took the fever and n'one could save her
  - And so died our Molly sweet Molly Malone
  - Her ghost wheels that barrow through streets wide and narrow
  - Singing cockles and mussels alive a-live O!

  - The snowbird sings a song he always sings
  - And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring
  - When I was young my heart was young then too
  - Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
  - But now I feel such emptiness within
  - For the thing that I want most in life is the thing I can't win
  - Spread your tiny wings and fly away
  - And take the snow back with you, where it came from on that day
  - The one I love forever is untrue
  - And if I could, you know that I would, fly away with you
  - The breeze along the river seems to say
  - That she'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
  - So little snowbird take me with you when you go
  - To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

  - Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose
  - And Ike he just gazed on his Pike County rose
  - Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
  - Down in the sand she lay rollin' about
  - While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
  - He said Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
  - Well the Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
  - The last piece of bacon that mornin' was fried
  - Ike he got discouraged and Betsy got mad
  - The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad
  - Well a miner said Betsy will you dance with me
  - I will now old Hoss if you don't make too free
  - But don't dance me hard do you want to know why
  - Doggone you I'm chocked full of strong alkali

  - '"Hi" said the little leather winged bat'
  - '"I''ll tell you the reason that,'
  - The reason that I fly in the night,
  - Is because I lost my hearts delight"
  - '"Hi" said the woodpecker sitting on a fence'
  - '"Once I courted a handsome wench,'
  - She got saucy and from me fled
  - Ever since then my head's been red"
  - '"Hi" said the bluebird as she flew'
  - '"If I were a young man I''d have two'
  - If one got saucy and wanted to go,
  - I'd have a new string for my bow"
  - '"Hi" said the blackbird to the crow'
  - '"What makes mankind hate us so"'
  - Ever since Noah's been born
  - We've been pulling up young green corn"

  - There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home
  - For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
  - Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes
  - It's only seven miles to Mary Anne
  - It's only seven miles to Mary Anne
  - You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
  - And I'll bet there's hot biscuits in the pan
  - Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
  - It's only five more miles to Mary Anne
  - It's only five more miles to Mary Anne
  - That wind's a-howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's scream
  - And we'd best be movin' faster, if we can
  - Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
  - It's only three more miles to Mary Anne
  - It's only three more miles to Mary Anne
  - Get up Dan you ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
  - I'm so weary but I'll help it, if I can
  - All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while rest
  - It's just another mile to Mary Anne
  - It's just another mile to Mary Anne
  - Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
  - He'd have made it but he just wouldn't leave ol' Dan
  - Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns
  - He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne
  - He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne.

  - When I was young I used to wait
  - On the boss and give him his plate
  - And Pass the bottle when he got dry
  - And brush away the blue-tail fly
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - My master's gone away
  - And when he'd ride in the afternoon
  - I'd follow after with a hickory broom
  - The pony being rather shy
  - When bitten by a blue-tail fly
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - My master's gone away
  - One day he ride around the farm
  - The flies so numerous they did swarm
  - One chanced to bite him on the thigh
  - The devil take the blue-tail fly
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - My master's gone away
  - The pony run, he jump, he pitch
  - He threw my master in the ditch
  - He died and the jury wondered why
  - The verdict was the blue-tail fly
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - My master's gone away
  - They lay him under a 'simmon tree
  - His epitaph is there to see
  - '"Beneath this stone I''m forced to lie'
  - The victim of a blue-tail fly"
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care
  - Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care

  - Soldier, oh, soldier
  - A-coming from the plain
  - He courted the lady
  - Through honor and through fame
  - Her beauty shone so bright
  - And that never could be told
  - She always loved the soldier
  - Because he was so bold
  - Fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la, la
  - Soldier, oh, soldier
  - If I would be your bride
  - But for fear of my father
  - Some danger might betide
  - Then he pulled it out sword and pistol
  - And he hung them by his side
  - Swore, he would be married
  - No matter what betide
  - Fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la, la
  - Then he took her to the parson
  - And of course, home again
  - There he met her father
  - And seven armed me
  - Let's fly says the lady
  - I fear we shall be slain
  - Hold your hand says the soldier
  - And never fear again
  - Fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la, la
  - Then he pulled it out sword and pistol
  - And he caused them to rattle
  - The lady held the horse
  - While the soldier fought in battle
  - Hold your hand says the old man
  - Do not be so bold
  - You shall have my daughter
  - And thousand pounds of gold
  - Fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la, la
  - Fight on said the lady
  - The portion is too small
  - Hold your hand says the old man
  - And you shall have it all
  - He took them right straight home
  - And he called them son and dear
  - Not because he loved them
  - But only through fear
  - Fa, la, la, la, fa, la, la, la

  - When I was a bachelor I lived all alone
  - I worked at the weaver's trade
  - And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
  - Was to woo a fair young maid
  - I wooed her in the winter time
  - Part of the summer too
  - And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong
  - Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew
  - One night she knelt close by my side
  - When I was fast asleep
  - She threw her arms around my neck
  - And then began to weep
  - She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
  - Ah, me, what could I do?
  - So all night long, I held her in my arms
  - Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew
  - Again I am a bachelor, I live with my son
  - We work at the weaver's trade
  - And every single time that I look into his eyes
  - He reminds me of that fair young maid
  - He reminds me of the wintertime

  - And the name of our ship was the Golden Vanity
  - And we feared she would be taken by the Spanish enemy
  - As she sailed in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - As she sailed in the Lowland Sea
  - Then up stepped our cabin boy and boldly outspoke he
  - And he said to our captain, "What would you give to me
  - If I would swim along side of the Spanish enemy
  - And sink her in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - And sink her in the Lowland Sea?"
  - '"Oh, I would give you silver and I would give you gold'
  - And my own fairest daughter your bonny bride shall be
  - If you will swim along side of the Spanish enemy
  - And sink her in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - And sink her in the Lowland Sea"
  - Then the boy he made him ready and overboard sprang he
  - And he swam alongside of the Spanish enemy
  - And with his brace and auger in her sides he bored holes three
  - He sunk her in the Lowland, Lowland low
  - Yes, he sunk her in the Lowland Sea
  - Then quickly he swam back to the cheering of the crew
  - But the captain would not heed him for his promise he did rue
  - And he scorned his poor entreatings when loudly he did sue
  - And he left him in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - He left him in the Lowland Sea
  - Then quickly he swam round to the port side
  - And up and to his messmates full bitterly he cried
  - '"Oh, messmates, draw me up for I''m drifting with the tide'
  - And I'm sinking in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - I'm sinking in the Lowland Sea"
  - Then his messmates drew him up, but on the deck he died
  - And they stitched him in his hammock which was so fair and wide
  - And they lowered him overboard and he drifted with the tide
  - And he sank in the Lowland, Lowland, low
  - He sank in the Lowland Sea

  - There was a little railroad train with loads and loads of toys
  - All starting out to find a home with little girls and boys
  - And as that little railroad train began to chug along
  - The little engine up in front was heard to sing this song
  - Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo
  - I feel so good today
  - Oh, clear the track, oh clickety clack
  - I'll go my merry way
  - The little train went roaring on, so fast, it seemed to fly
  - Until it reached a mountain rising almost to the sky
  - The little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away
  - But halfway to the top, it just gave up and seemed to say
  - I can't go on, I can't go on
  - I'm weary as can be
  - I can't go on, I can't go on
  - This job is not for me
  - The toys got out to push but all in vain alas, alack
  - And then a great big engine came a whistling down the track
  - They asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountainside
  - But with a high and mighty sneer, it scornfully replied
  - Don't bother me, don't bother me
  - To pull the likes of you
  - Don't bother me, don't bother me
  - I've better things to do
  - The toys all started crying 'cause that engine was so mean
  - And then there came another one, the smallest ever seen
  - But though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along
  - She hitched on to the train and as she pulled, she sang this song
  - I think I can, I think I can
  - I think I have a plan
  - And I can do most anything
  - If I only think I can
  - Then up that great big mountain went the cars all full of toys
  - And soon they reached their waiting arms of happy girls and boys
  - And though that ends the story, it will do you lots of good
  - To take a lesson from the little engine that could
  - Just think you can, just think you can
  - Just have that understood
  - And very soon you'll start to say
  - I always knew I could
  - I knew I could, I knew I could
  - I knew I could, I knew I could
  - I knew I could, I knew I could, I knew I could...

  - And when I opened up my mouth a pop would drop right in

  - Boom boom boom, an awful crash, they shook with fright to hear
  - The monkey, wolf and elephant all turned quite white with fear
  - Cried the wolf "lets run from all this din, I see your point of view"

  - He bites it day by day

  - The southwind is a baker

  - I know a wee squirrel who lives in an oak
  - He loves a good lunch and he loves a good joke
  - There's a wee bit of Scotch in his family tree
  - He's Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - (He's Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee)
  - Of chestnuts and acorns, he's gathered a store
  - Although he has plenty, he still gathers more
  - And he has them for breakfast, for luncheon and tea
  - Young Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - (Young Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee)
  - His brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts
  - Quite often will gather and have a fine dance
  - And they leap through the air precariously
  - With Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - (With Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee)
  - Once while they were dancing a hunter came by
  - And all of these squirrels the hunter did spy
  - And he lifted his rifle and aimed carefully
  - At Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - (At Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee)
  - The rifle went off with a terrible blast
  - But Angus McFergus was faster than fast
  - And the bullets went deep in the poor old oak tree
  - But it never touched Angus McFergus Dundee
  - (But it never touched Angus McFergus Dundee)
  - The hunter looked round but the squirrels were gone
  - Of all of those dancers there wasn't a one
  - They were all safely hidden in that friendly oak tree
  - With Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - I often imagine that I'd like to be
  - A funny wee squirrel and live in a tree
  - Pay no rent and no taxes and get my lunch free
  - Like Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee
  - (Like Angus McFergus McTavish Dundee)

  - All the bread and cheese I gotta put it on the shelf;
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - The rats and the mice, they led me such a life,
  - I had to go to London to get myself a wife.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - The roads were so slick and the lanes were so narrow,
  - Had to take her home in a old wheelbarrow;
  - Got my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - The wheelbarrow broke and my wife had a fall,
  - Down came wheelbarrow, wife and all.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swap my wheelbarrow got me a horse;
  - Then I rode from cross to cross.
  - Got my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my horse and got me a mare;
  - Then I rode from fair to fair.
  - Got my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my mule and got me a cow;
  - And in that trade I just learned how.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my cow and got me a calf;
  - In that trade I lost just half.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my calf and got me a mule;
  - Then I rode like a dog-gone fool.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my mule and I got me a sheep;
  - Then I rode till I went to sleep.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my sheep and got me a goat;
  - Rode to the election, sold my vote.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my goat and got me a rat;
  - Put it in the haystack to run the cat.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my rat and got me a hen;
  - What a pretty little think I had then.
  - To my wing wong waddle
  - To my jack straw saddle
  - To my jon fair faddle
  - To my long way home
  - Swapped my hen and got me a mole;
  - And the dog-gone thing ran straight to its hole.
  - To my wing wong waddle

  - '''Tis advertised in Boston, New York and Buffalo'
  - Five hundred brave Americans, a-whaling for to go, singing
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - They send you to New Bedord, a famous whaling port
  - And give you to some land-sharks to board and fit you out
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - They tell you of the clipper-ships-a-going in and out
  - And say you'll take five hundred sperm before you're six months out
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - It's now we're out to sea, my boys, the wind comes on to blow
  - One half the watch is sick on deck, the other half below
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - The Skipper's on the quarter-deck a-squinting at the sails
  - When up above the lookout sights a mighty school of whales
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Then lower down the boats my boys and after him we'll travel
  - But if you get to nearest fluke he'll pick you through the devil
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Now we have got him turned up, we tow him alongside
  - We over with our blubber-hooks and rob him of his hide
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - When we get home, our ship made fast, and we get through our sailing
  - A winding glass around we'll pass and damn this blubber whaling!
  - Blow, ye winds in the morning, And blow, ye winds, high-o!
  - Clear away your running gear, And blow, ye winds, high-o!

  - Our barque was far, far from the land
  - When the fairest of our gallant band
  - Grew deadly pale, and pined away
  - Like the twilight dawn of an autumn day
  - We watched him through long hours of pain
  - Our fears were great, our hopes in vain
  - Death's call he heard; made no alarm
  - He smiled and died in his messmate's arms
  - We had no costly winding sheet
  - We placed two round shot at his feet
  - 'And in his hammock, snug and sound:'
  - A kingly shroud like marble bound
  - We proudly decked his funeral vest
  - With a starry flag upon his breast
  - We gave him this as a badge so brave
  - Then he was fit for a sailor's grave
  - Our voices broke, our hearts turned weak
  - And tears were seen on the brownest cheek
  - A quiver played on the lip of pride
  - As we lowered him down our ship's dark side
  - A splash, a plunge and our task was o'er
  - And the billows rolled as they rolled before
  - And many a prayer said to the wave
  - That lowered him in a sailor's grave

  - A ramblin' reckless hobo left his happy home
  - Started on a western trip, by himself alone
  - He said, upon this western trip I guess I'll have some fun
  - Standing at a station house this is the song he sung
  - Standing on a platform smoking a cheap cigar
  - Waiting for a freight train to catch an empty car
  - Thinking of those good old times, wishing they'd come again
  - I'm a thousand miles away from home, bumming a railroad train
  - Kind miss, kind miss, won't you give me a bite to eat
  - A little piece of cold corn bread, a little piece of meat?
  - She threw her arms around me, say, I'll love you as a friend
  - But if I give to you this time, you'll be bumming around again
  - Kind miss, kind miss, don't talk to me so rough
  - You think I am a hobo because I look so tough
  - She took me in her kitchen, she treated me nice and kind
  - She put me in the notion of bumming all the time
  - When I left her kitchen I went strolling down in town
  - I heard a double header blow, I thought it was western bound
  - I walked out to the railroad, out to the railroad shop
  - I heard the agent tell a man, the freight train would not stop
  - My heart began to rove around, and I began to sing
  - If that freight train goes through this town, I'll catch it on the wing
  - I pulled my cap down over my eyes, and walked out to the track
  - And caught the stirrup of an empty car, and never did look back
  - I got off in Danville, got stuck on a Danville girl
  - You bet your life she's out of sight, she wears the Danville curl
  - She wears her hair on the back of her head, like high toned people do
  - But if a west-bound train pulls out tonight I'll bid that girl adieu
  - Now I am in your city, boys, trying to do what's right
  - Don't think because I am a railroad boy that I am not all right
  - My pocketbook is empty, my heart is filled with pain
  - Ten thousand miles away from home, bumming a railroad train

  - Oh her eyes were as bright as the diamonds every night
  - And wavy black was her hair
  - He courted her both night and day
  - '''Til to marry they did agree'

  - She threw herself in Willie Moore's arms
  - As oftime had done before
  - But little did he think when they parted that night
  - Sweet Anna he would see no more
  - It was about the tenth of May
  - The time I remember well
  - That very same night her body disappeared
  - In a way no tongue could tell
  - Sweet Annie was loved both far and near
  - Had friends most all around
  - And in a little brook before the cottage door
  - The body of sweet Anna was found
  - She was taken by her weeping friends
  - And carried to her parent's room
  - And there she was dressed in a shroud of snowy white
  - And laid her in a lonely tomb
  - Her parents now are left all alone
  - One mourns and the other one weeps
  - And in a grassy mound before the cottage door
  - The body of sweet Anna still sleeps
  - This song was composed in the flowery West
  - By a man you may never have seen
  - Oh I'll tell you his name but it is not in full
  - His initials are JRD

  - 'A Christmas bell was crying, then Santa heard it say:'
  - '"I just can''t seem to jingle and I can''t go on the sleigh!"'
  - Then Santa soon discovered the reason that it cried -
  - The bell that couldn't jingle, it had nothing there inside!
  - 'Then Santa said: "Jack Frost will bring my Christmas gift to you'
  - And on Christmas Eve you'll jingle, just like you were brand new!"
  - Then Jack Frost froze a teardrop, so each time that it swayed
  - The bell that couldn't jingle, jingle, it went jingling all the way -
  - Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way!
  - The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way
  - 'Then Santa said: "Jack Frost will bring my Christmas gift to you'
  - And on Christmas Eve you'll jingle, just like you were brand new!"
  - Then Jack Frost froze a teardrop, so each time that it swayed
  - The Bell That Couldn't Jingle, jingle, it went jingling all the way -
  - Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way!
  - The bell that couldn't jingle, it went jingling all the way
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!
  - It went jingling all the way!

  - I'll sing a little song but it ain't very long
  - About a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
  - And why it was I never could tell
  - For that young man was always well
  - That young man was always well
  - He planted his corn on June the last
  - In July it was up to his eye
  - In September there came a big frost
  - And all that young man's corn was lost
  - All that young man's corn was lost
  - He started to the field and got there at last
  - The grass and weeds was up to his chin
  - The grass and weeds had grown so high
  - It caused that poor man for to sigh
  - Caused that poor man for to sigh
  - Now his courtship had just begun
  - She said, "Young man have you hoed your corn?"
  - '"I''ve tried I''ve tried I''ve tried in vain'
  - But I don't believe I'll raise one grain
  - Don't believe I'll raise one grain"
  - '"Why do you come to me to wed'
  - If you can't raise your own cornbread?
  - Single I am and will remain
  - For a lazy man I won't maintain
  - A lazy man I won't maintain"
  - He hung his head and walked away
  - Saying "Kind miss you'll rue the day
  - You'll rue the day that you were born
  - For giving me the devil 'cause I wouldn't hoe my corn
  - Giving me the devil 'cause I wouldn't hoe my corn"
  - Now his courtship was to an end
  - On his way he then began
  - Saying "Kind miss I'll have another girl
  - If I have to ramble this big wide world
  - If I have to ramble this big wide world"

  - Here's a story about a sinner,
  - He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
  - But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
  - And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
  - It turned him to the booze,
  - And he got mixed up with a floosie
  - And she led him to a life of indecision.
  - The floosie made him spend his dole
  - She left him lying on Skid Row
  - A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
  - It's such a shame.
  - Oh demon alcohol,
  - Sad memories I cannot recall,
  - Who thought I would say,
  - Damn it all and blow it all,
  - Oh demon alcohol,
  - Memories I can't recall,
  - Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
  - Sad memories I can't recall,
  - Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
  - 'Bargain wine, pink gin, '
  - 'He''ll drink anything, '
  - 'Port, pernod or tequila, '
  - 'Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks, '
  - 'As long as all his troubles disappear. '
  - 'But he messed up his life, when he beat up his wife, '
  - 'And the floosie''s gone and found another sucker '
  - 'She''s gonna turn him on to drink '
  - 'She''s gonna lead him to the brink '
  - 'When his money''s gone, '
  - 'She''ll leave him in the gutter, '
  - 'It''s such a shame. '
  - 'Oh demon alcohol, '
  - 'Sad memories I can''t recall, '
  - 'Who thought I would say, '
  - Damn it all and blow it all

  - Sorry Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
  - If there's been trouble I will plead not guilty.
  - It must be someone else, you know it can't be me.
  - My wife and I were separated just the other day,
  - The last thing that she said to me was brother you will pay.
  - I better pay her every week, I better never fail,

  - I filed my income tax return, I thought I'd save some dough.
  - I cheated just a little bit, I knew they'd never know.
  - I got some money back this year, like I always do,

  - Ladies and gentlemen in this corner battling John.
  - Fighting the champion Bad Bad Whiskey.
  - And the official the one and only Buster Poindexter
  - Round 1 The fights begun.
  - Whiskey walks out and nails him some.
  - Round 2
  - Whiskey ain't through, both of Johns eyes are turning blue.
  - Round 3
  - It's hard to see cause whiskey is moving too fast for me.
  - Knock'm down whiskey, he shouldn't have hit you first.
  - Knock'm down whiskey, he shouldn't have hit you first.
  - Knock'm down whiskey, go on and do your worst
  - Round 4
  - Whiskey hits him some more there goes john out on the floor
  - Round 5
  - Johns half alive hanging on to whiskey trying to survive.
  - Round 6
  - He tries to mix but whiskey's got him in a awful fix.
  - Round 7
  - John goes back weak in the knees with both eyes black.
  - Round 8
  - Whiskeys still straight but John is swinging like a rusty gate.
  - Round 9
  - I see the losing side. According to points Johns far behind.
  - Round 10, looks like the end.
  - Whiskey keeps hitting him again and again.
  - Johns folding up like a paper sack.
  - Oh there goes John he's flat on his back.
  - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
  - Ladies and gents that's the end of the bout.
  - Bad bad whiskey has knocked him out.
  - Come on over here bad bad whiskey and say a few words to the fans.
  - Uh I like to say hello to, uh, my old grandad and uh my papa jack.
  - It'a good fight, I glad I win.

  - Most gals'll try to help you
  - When you are on the lam
  - A big ole pot of coffee
  - And a jumbo tin of Spam
  - But not old Sal, she's a mean old gal
  - Meaner than any man
  - And every time I'm with her
  - I don't know who I am
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - She's mean
  - She'll give you a jug of whiskey
  - When you're on the cleanse
  - She'll do the damnedest things
  - And never make amends
  - When you come to her apartment
  - She'll act like you are friends
  - But have no doubt, she'll stomp you out
  - When her passion ends
  - Some gals like a ball peen hammer
  - But Sal prefers a sledge
  - She broke down the bathroom door
  - And forced me on the ledge
  - She took that thing and hit me
  - Right across the head
  - I may a still a been breathin'
  - But I looked like I was dead
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Oh man, she's mean
  - I s'pose that I am lucky
  - The way she put me down
  - 'She chased her last fella with a rusty razor '
  - All over town
  - 'You may start out smiling '
  - But soon you'll wear a frown
  - Next stop the undertaker
  - Then six feet underground
  - Sal once put a horseshoe
  - Inside a boxing glove
  - And stromed on down to Broadway
  - To find a man to love
  - Found him in church house
  - Singin' like a dove
  - Now he's a statistic
  - With the Lord above
  - Heard there was this fella
  - Got off her bedroom floor
  - He'd been tore up pretty good
  - I tell you he was sore
  - Sal was out of band-aids
  - So he gimped down to the store
  - Saw her buyin' codeine
  - She whipped him some more
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - One time in Puerto Rico
  - On a fishing trip
  - Sal could no catch nothin'
  - She was about to flip
  - She stormed back to the resort
  - And really lost her grip
  - Came back with a shotgun
  - And killed three-dozen fish
  - Some folks need a face lift
  - A little nip and tuck
  - Others don't need nothin'
  - But they got all the luck
  - One such good lookin' fella
  - Looked like he hit a truck
  - When Sal got disappointed
  - He couldn't give her a second... (Hush your mouth!)
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Damn, she's mean
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal
  - Mean spirited Sal

  - (Here we go again)
  - An Amazon with a sexual peccadillo
  - Broke me in
  - My first sin
  - Just tossed me around as if I was a pillow
  - My first sin
  - My first sin
  - She left me bound and weepin' like a willow
  - My first sin
  - She broke me in
  - She had a picture of a hippie
  - Tattooed right on her spine
  - That read "Viva la revolution!
  - Nineteen hundred and sixty-nine!"
  - Everybody would warn me
  - Baby sister would warn me
  - Dear old mama would warn me
  - All the neighbors would warn me
  - Everybody would warn me
  - You better leave that woman alone
  - I should have learned and let it be a lesson
  - My first sin
  - My first sin
  - But I went back and kept up with my messin'
  - Broke me in
  - Broke me in
  - Now all the priests are hooked on my confessions
  - My first sin
  - My first sin
  - Oh my mama used to warn her
  - She'd call her on the telephone
  - That saintly woman used to warn her
  - You'd better leave my poor son alone
  - Better leave my brother alone
  - Better leave my sister alone
  - Better leave my papa alone
  - Better leave my doggie alone
  - Oh mama used to warn her
  - You'd better leave my family alone
  - Now I'm cast out, locked in an institution
  - My first sin
  - My first sin
  - This straight jacket is my retribution
  - Broke me in
  - Broke me in
  - 'Forgive me Lord, I don''t know what I''m doin'' '
  - My first sin
  - My first sin
  - But now there is an angry nurse here
  - Full fashion stockings, eight-inch heels
  - And every night around midnight
  - 'Into my padded cell she steals '
  - Everybody would warn me
  - Baby sister would warn me
  - Dear old mama would warn me
  - All the neighbors would warn me
  - Everybody would warn me
  - You'd better leave that woman alone
  - My first sin!

  - I can't believe the things I see on Broadway today
  - The ladies of the evening are going away
  - Disney's built a fortress in the heart of Times Square
  - The most wholesome people will soon be there
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - Hubert had his circus on Forty-Second street
  - The most fabulous freaks you'd ever want to meet
  - To us that emporium was built on hallowed ground
  - But the city fathers shut it down
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - No more raunch, no more sleeze
  - Not even one old time polite striptease
  - They don't rob, they don't steal
  - And they confuse that Batman's car with a pimpmobile
  - They don't curse, they don't swear
  - And on Sunday mornings they are lost in prayer
  - They don't lie, they don't cheat
  - They're Christian soldiers and they're marching down our street
  - Grant's was the best bar I was ever in
  - The center of the universe, a cauldron of sin
  - Sure sometimes when the lights went out, someone would get shot
  - That's no reason to bring back Camelot
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - They don't smoke. They don't drink
  - They'll turn this town into a mall
  - And I don't know what to think
  - In the golden days of yore
  - Grayline would take them on a tour
  - It was them, it was us
  - But at least they would remain upon the bus
  - They say thanks, they say please
  - And they cover up their noses when they sneeze
  - They have jobs, no welfare
  - They don't even know the meaning of despair
  - They don't shout, they don't spit
  - There aren't many crimes they're willing to commit
  - They don't pack guns, they don't pull knives
  - I don't know how these people think they will survive

  - He sort of looked at me and smiled, And whispered in my ear.
  - '"I''m nuts about screwy music.'
  - I'm screwy about nutty rhythm.
  - I'm dilly over all silly melodies, Crazy as a loon can be.
  - I'm daffy about goofy tempo,
  - I'm goofy about daffy changes,
  - I'm dippy over all dizzy harmony, Written in a minor key.
  - I love to hear sounds that are queer, I'm eccentric they say.
  - There's a boot in a flute, Or a mellow moon in cello.
  - I'm nuts about screwy music.

  - And sometimes it's this mean old world
  - That makes me feel alone
  - I wanna feel some joy
  - Like a little boy
  - She can take away this pain
  - I'm feelin' today
  - Gotta get away
  - Gotta get away
  - Gotta get away from the devil
  - Gotta get away from the world
  - And the closer that I get to heaven
  - That's the closer I get to that girl
  - Gotta get away
  - Gotta get away
  - Sometimes I get so hurt
  - And betrayed by a friend
  - And I know it's gonna take some time
  - For that hurt to mend
  - 'I''m gonna see that girl '
  - She's the best girl in the world
  - Curl up in her arms
  - For a long weekend
  - Gotta get away
  - Gotta get away
  - Gotta get away from the devil
  - Gotta get away from the world
  - And the closer that I get to heaven
  - That's the closer I get to that girl
  - Gotta get away

  - After working all day I head to the bar
  - My friends are all there and oh, how witty they are
  - We talk of the events of the day
  - Until we invariably say
  - 'GROUP: How dare you treat us this way'
  - (Spittoon sound effect)
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - The worst beer that I've ever had
  - It's so abominably bad it would make a gay man sad
  - It's the worst beer that I've ever had
  - I've traveled all over the world
  - I've sipped a porter in every port of call
  - I've had Sapporo in Japan, that strange exotic land
  - Served in a chilled bottle or a can
  - I've had Red Stripe in the Jamaican sun
  - Served alone or with a jug of white rum
  - I've had the Pilsner Urquell brewed in a former communist hell
  - But this stuff's not fit for a bum
  - I've imbibed a Newcastle Brown
  - It's the only way to bear that old town
  - I've had Fosters down under that would make an abo chunder
  - And tie his kangaroo down
  - In Ireland the Guinness is stout
  - They say it's the cure for the gout
  - By the holy dad, are you congenitally mad?
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - The worst beer that I've ever had
  - It's so abominably bad it would make a gay man sad
  - It's the worst beer that I've ever had
  - 'BUSTER: America''s favorite talking drummer, Tony Machine!'
  - 'GROUP: Look at that caveman go!'
  - (Singing)
  - Beer comes in all forms and sorts
  - Six packs, barrels and quarts
  - You've got your Pilsner, your lager, your hearty old ale
  - By comparison, this stuff fails!
  - In Milwaukee I once took the tour
  - I fancied myself quite the connoisseur
  - Until the tour guide, he said, "I think you're ready for bed"
  - I said, "good man, I've only had four"
  - 'GROUP: Four beers'
  - 'BUSTER: Look who''s talking'
  - 'GROUP: Ave Maria'
  - In Texas the lone star is cool
  - And cowboys ain't nobody's fools
  - And they get off of their horse and drink with such force
  - They eventually fall off of their stools
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - The worst beer that I've ever had
  - By the holy dad, are you congenitally mad?
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - California is sunny and fine (Fer sure)
  - But they're obsessed with domestic white wine
  - The denizens, I fear, won't drink enough beer
  - But I really can't blame them this time
  - This is the worst beer that I've ever had
  - The worst beer that I've ever had
  - It's so abominably bad it would make a gay man sad
  - It's the worst beer that I've ever had
  - Sing hearty (The worst beer that I've ever had)
  - Sing lustily (The worst beer that I've ever had)
  - Has the Orwellian prophecy finally come to this
  - Have they actually got us drinking...(Schlitz?)
  - (Spoken) I don't do blue
  - This is the worst
  - Unequivocably
  - Indisputably
  - Irrevocably the worst
  - Beer that I've ever
  - 'GROUP: Had!'
  - 'BUSTER: Sweet Adeline!'

  - My girl baby sister saw it on her block
  - Then I come up to join her and we start to rock
  - The baby hears the beat and man it is a shock
  - When he goes
  - A rockin' type a boogie is the kind a song
  - That makes this little baby wanna sing along
  - And though he maybe gets the tune alittle wrong
  - He still goes
  - (Boogie-on-na-day)
  - He isn't too young to really feel the beat
  - He rocks back and forth in his little seat
  - He claps both his hands and he taps his feet
  - And he sings
  - He is a hully-gully-bouncin-baby-boy
  - You know the record player is his favorite toy
  - And don't forget he's eveybodys pride and joy
  - When he goes
  - I know there isn't anyone to take a bet
  - But surely he's the youngest teenager yet
  - And probably the hippest of the diaper set
  - '''Cause he goes'
  - (Go man, I like that!)
  - He strolls in his stroller with the radio on
  - He doesn't go to sleep until the musics gone
  - He imitates the singer in the group
  - With a low down voice
  - And when its time to tuck him in his little bed
  - With all that music runnin' through his sleepy head
  - The little fella doesn't say goodnight
  - Instead, but he says
  - (Gone!)

  - And drifting helplessly
  - Without your love to guide me
  - When you're not beside me
  - I'm just driftwood
  - How long can I go on my dear without you

  - This is all I'll ever be
  - This is what you've made of me

  - My sun goes down, my days are past
  - And I must leave this world at last
  - Judge Daniels has my sentence passed
  - These prison walls I'll leave at last
  - Nothing to cheer my drooping head
  - Until I'm numbered with the dead
  - His feeble hands fell gently down
  - His chattering tongue soon lost its sound
  - It strikes with terror to my heart
  - To see his soul and body part
  - His awful ghost, I know I'll see
  - Gnawing his flesh in misery
  - With flaming eye, he'll say to me
  - '"Why did you take my life away?"'
  - Awful, indeed, to think of death
  - In perfect health to lose my breath
  - But little time to pray to God
  - Now I must try that awful road

  - His name would always be, always be recorded in history
  - His name would always be, always be recorded in history
  - It gives me inspiration to sing, his heroic stand in the Philippines
  - No man can be braver than General MacArthur, the Son of America
  - With his traditional warriors at his side, he gave the Japanese the first surprise,
  - For when they called on him to surrender, "I am an American" was his answer,
  - '"And in the name of democracy, I will die for freedom and liberty",'
  - They don't come no braver than General MacArthur, the Son of America
  - Let us go back in past history, go think George Washington and General Lee,
  - Hmm even hailin' Patrick Henry, Abe Lincoln - emancipator in slavery
  - But we'll read of MacArthur when he's gone, for he's a genius if one was ever
    born
  - They don't come no braver than General MacArthur, the Son of America.
  - When you hear me singing my characteristic song, from the book of editions that

  - This vocabulary that is list in me, it is owing to my high class propensity,
  - I am not versed in psychology, I'm a man who can sing intelligently,

  - With the stars and stripes laying at his side, for this flag he intend to die,
  - MacArthur, the man with the heart of steel, to the invading Japs he wouldn't never
    yield,
  - He told the Japanese for a fact, "I'm leaving Corregidor, but I'm coming back"
  - They don't come no braver than General MacArthur, the Son of America.

  - It was deep in the Jungles of Africa,
  - Where the bugs is thick as fleas,
  - And the heat will drive sane men crazy,
  - And the water's full o' disease
  - I went out walkin' with a beautiful girl,
  - Where the spotted honeysteppers fly,
  - We lay down under the bamboo trees,
  - I sang that Jungle Lullaby
  - Singin', swingin',
  - On a lazy afternoon in paradise
  - Croonin, swoonin,
  - That old time song, where the days are long,
  - It's a Jungle Lullaby
  - Well we made it down to a riverbank,
  - Spied a steamboat comin' along,
  - Then we hitched a ride, lawd, lookin' over the side,
  - Everything was goin' on wrong,
  - There was bird-eatin spiders, big as my fist,
  - Snakes that hung down like vines
  - And eyes that watched as we drifted along,
  - I sang that Jungle Lullaby
  - Singin', swingin',
  - On a lazy afternoon in paradise
  - Croonin, swoonin,
  - That old time song, where the days are long,
  - It's a Jungle Lullaby
  - Bom - bow - domp,...
  - Bomp - ow - domp - ay - oh...
  - Lay - dat - omp
  - Folks you know, when we got back into town that night,
  - There was excitement in the air.
  - I heard there was a party over at the Officers Club, so I took that girl on over,
  - Man, we walked in the joint, orchestra playin' so sweet I thought I'd die.
  - I got up on that old bandstand,
  - Sang that Jungle Lullaby,
  - Singin', swingin',
  - On a lazy afternoon in paradise
  - Croonin, swoonin,
  - That old time song, where the days are long,
  - It's a Jungle Lullaby

  - I drifted in the Doldrums, almost dead,
  - A weedy, watery, trail,
  - With a useless rag, hangin' above my head,
  - Not a breath o' breeze to fill my sail,
  - Then liftin' up my spyglass, ol' Buckley's hope,
  - I seen somethin' o'er the waves,
  - I throwed my things,
  - I left my boat,
  - And swam out on my way...
  - On a Desert Isle,
  - Here I sing, oh-de-lee-ee-oh-de-lay-ee,
  - Soft an' sweet
  - Got no shirt or shoes upon my feet,
  - Out in the middle of an o-o-ocean,
  - Doin' my thing,
  - I'm happy just to dream, and sing,
  - Out livin' like a marabout king,
  - Out on a Desert Isle
  - The shadin' palm trees bend an' sway,
  - The fish swim 'bout my feet,
  - And a breeze blowin' soft 'pon the cordgrass play,
  - A lazy old melody, cool an' sweet,
  - As the sun goes sinkin' in a painted sky,
  - My eye's on a pool of light,
  - Where the stars cast a twinklin' veil on high,
  - Where I sleep out everynight...
  - One mornin' the silence broke,
  - As beset by a sea high-horned in waves I awoke,
  - To find no remnants of that paradise,
  - What laid about me, were a changed, unfriendly land,
  - From beyond the compass' reach,
  - I sings this song of water an' dune,
  - Of wonders strange,
  - Out of the gloom, there came a sound like cryin' in the night,
  - My blue ruined eyes I thought lied,
  - A woman draggin' up, out of that squawlin' tide...
  - On a desert isle,
  - Oh-de-lee-oh-oh-de-lay-ee, tired an' beat,
  - Writin' help, in letters fifteen feet,
  - Out on the beach, beside an o-o-ocean,
  - Woe is me, a cryin baby bouncin' on my knee,
  - In a little grass shack built for three,
  - Out on a Desert Isle.

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/C.W._Stoneking:The_Greatest_Liar
  - Now ladies and gentlemen, we present for your entertainment tonight,
  - Down in the Starlight Hotel, all the way from New Orleans - King Hokum.
  - Hmmmm, Hmmmmm,
  - Hmmmmm, Hmmmmm,
  - Hmmmm, Hmmmmm,
  - Folks, I wanna tell you tonight about the World's greatest Liar,
  - That's right, the greatest that liar ever was, will be, has been, can a been
  - (And jelly bean!)
  - Hmph, ...Name of this this fella is Samuel, Jacob, Jackson... Jeremiah, Johnson...
  - Any name that be fittin' his present situation
  - (Uh, usually a situation be presently fittin' him, pair a handcuffs, and leg irons)
  - Yes, yes quieten down please, quiet down.
  - Now, I'm gonna refrain from usin' this man's name here tonight,
  - To conceal, to conceal the fact of his true identity - which is unknown to me.
  - Now Samuel was born early one mornin, I tell you,
  - There was many important folks there to witness his birth, who was they?
  - (I don't know!)
  - Well, what I've learned, through years of investigation, misinformation, and inebriation,
  - Is that that great liar was born to rich, but honest parents, who both died when
    he was only 12 years old.
  - My heart goes out to him. It was a blow he suffered again, with their passin,
    uh, in the street, eleven years later.
  - As an orphan, Samuel was subject to the most savage beatins, at the hands of the
    very folks
  - Into whose homes he was sent for the sole purpose, of burglary.
  - Now, while servin' in the Armed Forces,
  - Samuel Jacob Jehosophat Jellyroll Johnson,
  - Was wounded at the battle of Hastings. That was back round ten sixty six, uh,
    in the mornin',
  - After which he was discharged with the high distinction of never havin' enlisted.
  - The memories of war scarred Samuel the rest of his life, because he remembered
    nothing,
  - And though he often raised toasts to his fallen, bank balances,
  - He never taken a drink of liquor the rest of his life - that he paid for.
  - That's right Ladies and Gentlemen, only the best blues, hokum, and Jungle music,
  - Down in the Starlight Hotel, every night.

  - Some fingernail, a piece of her dress,
  - Apocathery, Devil's behes'
  - I will relate, the piteous consequence my mistake,
  - Fallin' slave to passin desire,
  - Makin' the dreaded Love me or Die.
  - Against a Jungle primeval green,
  - She had the looks of a beauty queen
  - No bangles or chain, wearin' broken shoe
  - Seventy-five cent bottle perfume.
  - I said, "Good mornin", I tipped my hat,
  - All the while I was cunning like a rat,
  - Smilin' gaily, looked her in the eye,
  - I felt in pocket, the Love me or Die
  - My past history, one to behold,
  - I studied magic from days of old,
  - Membership, secret societies,
  - Power and wealth in my family
  - But Matilda, Darling,
  - Why you don't take my wedding ring,
  - Like a demon under the floor,
  - I buried the hoodoo down the back door.
  - Lawd, word broke through the town,
  - That a fever strike Matilda down,
  - Nine thirty, the doctor arrive,
  - Priest come runnin', quarter to five.
  - Standin in the weeds early next day,
  - I saw the meat wagon rollin' away,
  - I seen Matilda layin in the back,
  - Her old mother wearin a suit of black
  - Sound the trumpet, and bang the drum,
  - I wait for me judgement to come,
  - I know her spirit is down beneath,
  - I hear the weepin and gnashing of the teeth.
  - Flames of Hell licks at my feet,
  - In the shadow of the Jungle I feel the heat,
  - Matilda's waiting in Hell for me too,
  - All 'cause she died from a bad hoodoo.

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Cage_The_Elephant:The_Lonesome_Death_Of_Hattie_Carroll
  - William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
  - With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
  - At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
  - And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
  - As they rode him in custody down to the station
  - And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
  - But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face
  - Now ain't the time for your tears
  - William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
  - Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
  - With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
  - And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
  - Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
  - And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
  - In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
  - But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face
  - Now ain't the time for your tears
  - Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
  - She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
  - Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
  - And never sat once at the head of the table
  - And didn't even talk to the people at the table
  - Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
  - And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
  - Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
  - That sailed through the air and came down through the room
  - Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
  - And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
  - But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
  - Take the rag away from your face
  - Now ain't the time for your tears
  - In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
  - To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
  - And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
  - And that even the nobles get properly handled
  - Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
  - And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
  - Stared at the person who killed for no reason
  - Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
  - And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
  - And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
  - William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
  - Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
  - Bury the rag deep in your face
  - For now's the time for your tears

  - Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
  - They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
  - I live in another world where life and death are memorized
  - Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes
  - A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
  - Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
  - But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
  - Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes
  - They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
  - They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is
  - But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
  - All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes
  - Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
  - Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel
  - Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
  - A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes

  - Out on the edge I go
  - And god only knows

  - Black is white when you
  - Run through the night
  - You got to fight somewhere
  - Way down there
  - Where only one thing is real
  - I'll have to do anything
  - To live how I feel
  - Way down there
  - Where only one thing is true
  - I will do anything
  - To get next to you
  - I ran through the street

  - The kid he told of the jewels and gold
  - To be had while he played the game
  - I'm worried not about the sentence I've got
  - You see my future it's strictly fame
  - Well I used to lay tricks to baffle the dicks
  - I would leave them a clue to find
  - Then I'd beat my retreat on back to easy street
  - All my thoughts of this jail behind
  - Only the characters know what I'm sayin'
  - Only the characters know what I mean
  - Only the characters have any idea
  - Only the characters have seen what I've seen
  - Well the old man listened till his dim eyes glistened
  - He said when the kid got through
  - Son you're young and you've only begun
  - But old men have a story too
  - It was late one day on a get-away
  - I had to shoot a young man down
  - It was a jewelry store and I was at the door
  - When the police came around
  - Well I made a draw and so did the law
  - Both our rods spit lead
  - When the smoke had cleared and the scene reappeared
  - One poor young dude lay dead
  - '...'
  - Well I was thrown in jail held without bail
  - Chalked up with first degree
  - I wasn't so game when my trial day came
  - Electric chair in front of me
  - So I tried to grin but it was useless then
  - My nerves were like the edge of a knife
  - And I held my breath for that verdict of death
  - But they sentenced me here for my life
  - Only the characters know what I'm sayin'
  - Only the characters know what I mean
  - Only the characters have any idea
  - Only the characters have seen what I've seen
  - So here I sit son I got my life near done
  - All my hopes and joys have fled

  - I'd cut the silver strings
  - That hold the moon
  - If you wanted me to
  - Wrap a rainbow round the milky way
  - In a bouquet
  - Just for you.
  - Baby bring your love to me
  - You know I love you so
  - And you will be mine
  - Until I have to go.
  - I'll write it all across the wall
  - Of the world for everyone's eyes
  - How my life begins and ends
  - Inside the sound of my lover's sighs.
  - Baby bring that love to me
  - You know that I love you so
  - And you will be mine
  - Until you have to go
  - Till I have to go.

  - When raindrops fall
  - And you're feeling low
  - Do you ever think it's useless
  - Do you feel like letting go
  - Do you ever sit and wonder
  - Will this world ever change
  - And just how long would it take
  - To change all these things.
  - Tell me why these things are still the same
  - Tell me why that no one seems to learn from our mistakes
  - Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
  - I understand I've lost the way myself
  - Just don't take that old road 'cause it leads to nowhere
  - We must return before the clock strikes twelve.
  - It's easy to do nothin'
  - When you're so busy night and day
  - You take a step in one direction
  - Then you take a step the other way
  - But don't stop tryin' if you stumble
  - Don't give up should you fall
  - You gotta keep searchin' for the pathway
  - That leads to you through the wall.
  - Don't look back oh
  - Don't look back or
  - You'll be left behind
  - Don't look back
  - If you ever want to find
  - Find your peace of mind.
  - Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
  - I understand I've lost the way myself
  - But don't take that old road
  - That old road that leads to nowhere
  - We must return before the clock strikes twelve.
  - So take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
  - I understand I've lost the way myself
  - Just don't take that old road
  - That old road that leads to nowhere
  - We must return before the clock strikes twelve.

  - I don't care if you never get old and
  - I don't care if it never gets cold

  - And they probably wont let my good friends in
  - So I don't want to go to heaven
  - Now some guy said "you got to serve somebody"
  - He can speak for himself
  - As far as I can see you make your own heaven
  - And you make your own hell
  - So don't ask me to join that throng
  - I prefer to make up my own song
  - I don't care if the streets are gold
  - I don't care if you never get old and

  - Well I know it's been a hard road for so long now
  - And it's taken you for a ride down down down
  - But you must laugh even though it seems that you should cry.
  - '...'
  - Each morning brings us a different day
  - And it's counting our lives down down down
  - But you must try until at last you'll know why.
  - A grain of sand, one single leaf
  - A candle by itself burning
  - I'm just a man, only a man
  - And the rules of life I'm still learning
  - Turn me round, turn me round
  - Well people for years I gathered the tears
  - I looked for the frowns on your faces
  - Now I walk down the street
  - And the people that I meet
  - One by one I've met thousands
  - And that's why I feel
  - That to give is the fruit
  - The fruit of living our lifes.

  - In the early, early morning
  - I Dreamed I Saw
  - This great city shinin'
  - With silver and gold
  - Thousands of birds were flying
  - And rivers like ribbons
  - Unrolled
  - Behind it this million mile rainbow
  - Like the promise that will
  - Never die
  - And a choir that must have numbered
  - Over ten-thousand
  - 'Their voices went clear through '
  - The sky
  - But then suddenly it happened
  - And a crack in the ground
  - Opened wide
  - Dark clouds covered
  - The daylight
  - And the air was a poisonous
  - Tide
  - And that
  - City fell down
  - Before my eyes
  - I was over almost when it started
  - Where beauty was nothin' remained
  - I fell to my knees in my own self-pity
  - My tears in the dust
  - Traced a stain
  - I wept there where no one could hear me
  - I cried out "Who would have sealed
  - My doom"
  - When suddenly right there
  - Where my tear-drops had fallen
  - The great miracle of life
  - Made a small flower bloom

  - The wicked king of clubs awoke
  - It was to his queen he turned
  - His lips were laughing as they spoke
  - His eyes like bullets burned
  - The sun's upon a gambling day
  - His queen smiled low and blissfully
  - Let's make some wretched fool pay
  - It was play she did agree.
  - He sent his deuce down into diamond
  - Four to heart and trey to spade
  - Three kings with their legions come
  - And preparations soon were made
  - They voted club the day's commander
  - Gave him an army face and number
  - All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
  - And the aces in the sky.
  - So he gave his seven first instructions
  - Spirit me a game of stud
  - Stakes unscarred by limitations
  - '''Tween a man named Gold and a man named Mudd'
  - Club filled bold with greedy vapors
  - Till his long green eyes did glow
  - Mudd was left with the sighs and trembles
  - Watching his hard earned money go.
  - Flushes fell on Gold like water
  - Tens they paired and paired again
  - But the aces only flew through heaven
  - The diamond jack called no man friend
  - The diamond queen saw Mudd's ordeal
  - Began to think of her long lost son
  - Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
  - And prayed to the angels every one.
  - Now the diamond queen she prayed and prayed
  - The diamond angel filled Mudd's hole
  - The wicked king of clubs himself
  - Fell face down in front of Gold.
  - Three kings come to club's command
  - The angels from the sky did ride
  - Three kings up on the streets of Gold
  - Three fireballs on the muddy side.
  - The club queen heard her husbands call
  - But that queen of the diamond's joy
  - When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
  - Turned out to be her wandering boy
  - Mudd he checked and Gold bet all
  - Mudd he raised and Gold did call
  - The smile just melted off his face
  - When Mudd turned over that diamond ace.
  - Here is what this story's told
  - You feel like Mudd you'll end up Gold
  - You feel like lost you'll end up found
  - So amigo lay thoses raises down.

  - Op Sam Brown was a lonesome convict
  - He come from a Red River town
  - There ain't no two ways about it
  - It was Texas law that shot Sam down
  - Ol' Sam Brown told me his story
  - It seems a bad check writer was he
  - Seven times down and seven times sorry
  - He had to spend his life under lock and key
  - I guess that some will say
  - He was worthless
  - And that he got only what was fair
  - But I'm here to say right now
  - Ol' Sam Brown was just a little person
  - Who caught up in this lifes
  - Great pull and tear
  - Ol' Sam Brown, he liked them outlaws
  - Billie the Kid, Frank and Jessie James
  - And I guess he read a thousand stories
  - Of the days when they roamed the plains
  - Tell me why didn't someone
  - Help him
  - To believe in himself
  - Some, too
  - Hell no, they'd rather give a man
  - About a hundred years
  - Just to prove they can be
  - Tougher than you
  - Ol' Sam Brown died on a Sunday morning
  - Layin' right there in that cement cell
  - Whith ragged convicts to mourn his passin'
  - And no loved ones to bid farewell
  - They used to tell him
  - Sam - straighten up
  - And fly right
  - They used to tell him
  - Sam - don't you stay out
  - Late at at night
  - And why ...
  - Can't you be like I am, Sam
  - Will you ever see the light?

  - The old woman finally caught me
  - Sneakin' 'round her cave
  - Her hair looked just like barbwire, boys
  - And her smile just like the grave
  - She asked me could I stay awhile
  - I said I'd better go
  - She slid her arm around my neck
  - And sweetly whispered no
  - It's cold and dark and lonely here
  - As soon enough you'll see
  - I'm oh so glad you stumbled in
  - I've been cravin' company
  - I cannot stay too long you know
  - I left some friends at home
  - Don't you fret about your friends
  - Down here we're all alone
  - What about my mother
  - I can't just leave her there to mourn
  - You don't have to think about her
  - Just forget you were ever born
  - I'll disappoint my father
  - You know he worked so hard for me
  - If you have to pay your father back
  - Just send him some misery
  - I'll miss, I said, a girl I know
  - I can't just leave there to pine
  - She's still got plenty of men to go
  - I'm sure she'll do just fine
  - What about my little boy
  - She said, he's just like you
  - Let a few short years roll by
  - He'll end up down here too
  - Then her pale green eyes began to glow
  - She placed her hand on mine
  - She smiled and said don't worry
  - You'll get used to me in time
  - As her cold tongue flickered toward
  - I spun myself around
  - Made a dive for the passageway
  - But the walls come crashing down
  - Now her eyes were the only light
  - My fevered brain could see
  - But I tore myself away from them
  - And fell down to my knees
  - I've come too far, I can't get back
  - I beseeched the Gods of men
  - Fame and fortune just laughed at me
  - Then silence once again
  - A whisper deep within
  - Embrace the God of Love
  - I lifted my face and through the tears
  - I saw light fall from above
  - I hurled myself into the wall
  - I ripped and clawed my way
  - Through the stinkin', clingin' loam
  - Back to the light of day
  - I crawled out into the wind again
  - The sky upon my face
  - I heard the earth sigh patiently
  - As it slid back into place
  - Now I'm back among the ones I love
  - I'm loved by them in turn
  - And it's only on the darkest night
  - That green eyed memory burns
  - So walk my friends, in the light of day
  - Don't go sneakin' 'round no holes
  - There justmight be something down there
  - Wants to gobble up your soul

  - And the walkin' dead and dyin' know
  - More than I can know

  - Of this valley far below

  - Waiting for the end

  - I got a honky tonk heart
  - And a juke box brain
  - I got the rock and roll rhythm
  - Runnin' in my veins
  - I got the Route 66
  - Tattoed on my chest
  - I park my horse
  - Out in the Wild wild west
  - I got a boogie woogie baby
  - With a juke box walk
  - Every time she talks
  - I got Route 66
  - Tattoed on my chest
  - I shoot my gun
  - Out in the Wild wild west
  - I got a honky tonk heart
  - And a juke box brain
  - I got the rock and roll rhythm
  - Runnin' in my veins
  - I got Route 66
  - Tattoed on my chest
  - I park my horse
  - Out in the Wild wild west
  - I have my hat out in the Wild wild west.

  - Once I took all the heart of a woman
  - Gave her nothin', really nothin', in return
  - Oh I treated her so cruel
  - I had a lot to learn
  - I took her for granted
  - And I just couldn't see
  - Any meaning in the warning
  - That she gave to me
  - Honey you'll get yours
  - Just like I got mine
  - Well you just wait and see
  - It's just a matter of time
  - So you know it's the truth
  - And you know it's a fact
  - You can't take someone's love
  - If you can't give it back
  - Give it back
  - Like she said it would, it happened
  - And I fell so deeply
  - In love with a woman
  - Who couldn't care less about me
  - So as I sit here in my lonely room
  - Waiting 'til who knows when
  - Now I can hear it coming back again
  - Oh you'll get yours
  - Like I got mine
  - You just wait and see
  - It's just a matter of time
  - Oh baby you'll get yours
  - Like I got mine
  - You just wait and see

  - Expensive restaurants and cheap hotels
  - You can forget till it makes no sense
  - Black black nights and promise rings
  - You can never get your mind back
  - Back to the way it was
  - When you were daylight for me
  - When the sky was so black
  - You couldn't see
  - Such a tiny star caught
  - In the great big sea
  - You were daylight for me
  - Did you toll alarm clocks
  - That crawl inside my ears
  - It's a cold day in the city
  - Same shit is hitting
  - A big fan in the sky
  - And the war is only beginning
  - And you're still afraid of the dark
  - But you were daylight for me
  - When the sky was so black you couldn't see
  - Such a tiny star caught in the great big sea
  - You were daylight... daylight... daylight...

  - No more light
  - So get used to the dark
  - Spend some time
  - With the hurt that's in your heart
  - Been sitting here many times before
  - You don't need the key when you've broken down the door
  - Is it love and happiness
  - Or another hopeless little accident?
  - Love can be too hard on your brain
  - Let it close your eyes for you
  - And you'll never see the same
  - Put a scar on your heart
  - And its hard to change
  - Scar on your heart
  - You stay clear for a number of years
  - You don't face the facts
  - And you never face your fears
  - If you fill your head up with history
  - How can you appreciate this mystery?
  - Love can be too hard on your brain
  - Let it close your eyes for you
  - And you'll never see the same
  - Put a scar on your heart
  - And its hard to change
  - Scar on your heart
  - Love can be too hard on your brain

  - Looking at the soft skin of yesterday's light fall upon you
  - Rising up off the pillowy haze that we gaze through
  - It's the song that I sing because I have to
  - I make a choice to raise my voice but you're hard to refuse
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - I couldn't drag it out
  - You couldn't settle me down
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - Peel off the yellowing pages of memories in black and white
  - When love was just a sweet idea we could lie beside
  - 'And it''s a price that we pay because we want to '
  - But it's worse to see the hurt when she's so much to lose
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - I couldn't drag it out
  - You couldn't settle me down
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - (To you, to you)
  - Trying on the tough skin of Saturday night falls around you
  - I'm thinking of the billowing blaze that surrounded you
  - Now it's the song that you sing because you have to, not 'cause you want to
  - And it's the hardest thing to choose when there's so much to lose
  - I wouldn't do that to you
  - I wouldn't do that to you (no)

  - Seemed like the sun would never go down
  - So we could clap our hands and gather around

  - Yeah, I learned the rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm)
  - And it wasn't very long
  - Till I was doin' the boogie woogie rhythm
  - Well, I prayed all week for Saturday night
  - Turn my back on the sun and put the sack out of sight
  - Take the long dusty road into town
  - My feet kept the rhythm as I walked the hot ground
  - But nothing could keep me from my favourite spot
  - Where the chicks were a-waitin' and the music was hot
  - Born to boogie (boogie)
  - Lord, I got the rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm)
  - And it wasn't very long
  - Till I done the boogie woogie rhythm
  - (Like this I did the boogie)
  - Well, Monday morning was always bad
  - But it was worth it all for the time I had
  - Lord oh Lordy, how I wish it would rain
  - Just the sun have mercy on a country boy's pain
  - But I make believe everything's all right
  - Gonna do it again come Saturday night
  - I do the boogie (boogie)
  - Yeah-yeah, with lots of rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm)

  - On the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot.
  - Dan dropped in about five o'clock.
  - Pulled off his coat, said "The night is short."
  - He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart.
  - He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops are gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried."
  - Well, Dan got happy and he started raving.
  - He pulled out a razor, but he wasn't shaving.
  - And all the cats knew to jump and hop,
  - '''Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop.'
  - He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops are gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried."
  - The cops heard Dan when he started to shout.
  - They all ran in to see what it was about.
  - And I heard him holler as they led him away.
  - He turned his head, and this is what he had to say.
  - He hollered, "Rave on children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops are gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried."
  - Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw.
  - He let us all know he wasn't scared of the law.
  - And through The black crossed bar he tossed a note.
  - And it said "It ain't my fault, hon, that I'm in here."
  - But He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops ain''t gone,'
  - And I've been Dixie fried."

  - Listen boy, ain't no joy when you're lonesome
  - Troubled time get you off on the wrong track
  - Listen to a man that's had a lot experience
  - If you do wrong then you'll never win her back
  - Well, you can't make love to somebody
  - When you got somebody else on your mind
  - I said, you can't make love to another
  - When you try, you're just wasting your time

  - I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
  - I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
  - It takes a worried man to sing this worried song
  - I'm goin' away, baby, 'til it won't be long
  - I'm goin' away, baby, it won't be long
  - You mistreated me, I'm going to leave my happy home
  - I'm going to the river, sit down on the ground
  - I'm going to the river, sit down on the ground
  - If the blues overtakes me, I'll jump overboard and drown
  - I woke up this morning, the blues were on my mind
  - I woke up this morning, the blues were on my mind
  - I was so down-hearted, I couldn't do nothin' but cry
  - When you see me leaving, baby, don't you cry
  - When you see me leaving, baby, don't you dry
  - If you mistreat me again, baby, you will surely die
  - Lord, I'm goin' away, honey, I can not stay
  - I'm goin' away, honey, I can not stay
  - I can't be down-hearted, mistreated this-a-way
  - Lord, I went up on the mountain, peeped in the little hole
  - I say, I went up on the mountain, peeped in the little hole
  - I saw two little monkeys doin' the monkey jellyroll

  - Where's my pal, where's my friend
  - All good things must have an end
  - Sad things and nothings
  - On and on they go
  - I guess he went to Mexico
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Buenas dias, got to go
  - Tengo que obedecer
  - Mi corazon
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Where's my mule, where's my dray
  - Straw hat's packed up and gone away
  - Mule don't go north and dray go slow
  - They both went to Mexico
  - Where's my sweetie, where's the face
  - That lit dark corners every place
  - She put up with me long time you know
  - And then she had to go to Mexico
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Buenas dias, got to go
  - Tengo que obedecer
  - Mi corazon
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Where's my brown dog, where's my hound
  - He liked my truck he hung around
  - But he's a canine romeo
  - And I guess he went to Mexico
  - Where's that woman so sweet, so mean
  - Her heart was cautious her mind was keen
  - She was always looking for the peccadillo
  - I hope she went to Mexico
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Buenas dias, got to go
  - Tengo que obedecer
  - Mi corazon
  - They all went to Mexico
  - Where's December's happy crew
  - With German bikes and sidecars too
  - They take the truck south to St. Louis, MO
  - Motorcycle all the way to Mexico
  - Where's my luck, where's my grace
  - Has it all been just a foolish chase
  - Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow
  - I think it might be time to head to Mexico

  - Nobody feels any pain
  - Tonight as I stand inside the rain
  - Ev'rybody knows
  - That Baby's got new clothes
  - But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
  - Have fallen from her curls.
  - She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
  - She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
  - And she aches just like a woman
  - But she breaks just like a little girl.
  - Queen Mary, she's my friend
  - Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
  - Nobody has to guess
  - That Baby can't be blessed
  - Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
  - With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
  - She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
  - She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
  - And she aches just like a woman
  - But she breaks just like a little girl.
  - It was raining from the first
  - And I was dying there of thirst
  - So I came in here
  - And your long-time curse hurts
  - But what's worse
  - Is this pain in here
  - I can't stay in here
  - Ain't it clear that
  - I just can't fit
  - Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
  - When we meet again
  - Introduced as friends
  - Please don't let on that you knew me when
  - I was hungry and it was your world.
  - Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
  - You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
  - Then you ache just like a woman
  - But you break just like a little girl.

  - '"It''s after twelve", said John and I must rush home like a deer'
  - My wife gets wild when one o'clock rolls near
  - And Brownie says you haven't any spunk at all
  - You got to be ashamed, I've got mine tamed
  - Come on around the block with me, you timid mouse
  - I will try and show you how a man goes in his house
  - He went in like a lion, a wild raving lion
  - And when he got inside, he slammed door
  - He says "Here I am and I don't give a continental"
  - Then he gave an awful roar
  - But a great big cup of mocha hit him on the coco
  - Followed by some huckleberry jam
  - And as she gently pulled out all the whiskers on his chin
  - She whispered that "I am a better man than you are Jim"
  - He went in like a lion, a wild raving lion
  - When she got through he came out like a lamb
  - When Brown came out he said "Old man she sure did beat you up"
  - Look out old man here comes another cup, heads up"
  - When I went in she threw her arms around my neck
  - And then she pitched you out an awful wreck
  - '"But are you going to stand for that" and Brownie answered "No"'
  - Just watch me going in again and stick for the show
  - He went in like a lion, a wild raving lion
  - He heard a record "playing "Home, Sweet Home"
  - He said "I love that tune"
  - She says "You can have it, kid"
  - As she bounced that record off his dome
  - She chased about like bubbles
  - He packed up all of his troubles
  - Long long traded hit him an awful slam
  - She had him chasing rainbows as that record flew like rain
  - She says "Goodbye forever, wait until we meet again"
  - He went in like a lion, a wild raving lion
  - When she got through he came out like a lamb
  - He went in like a lion, a wild raving lion
  - And when he got inside, he slammed door
  - He says "Well, here I am and I don't give a continental"

  - Step up, buddies, and listen to my song
  - I'll sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong
  - It's all about a man named Otto Wood
  - I can't tell you all, but I wish I could
  - He walked in the pawn shop, a rainy day
  - And with the clerk, he had a quarrel, they say
  - He pulled out his gun and he struck him a blow
  - And this is the way the story goes
  - The spread the news as fast they could
  - The sheriff served a warrant on Otto Wood
  - The jury said, "Murder in the second degree"
  - And the judge passed the sentence to the penitentiary
  - Otto, why didn't you run?
  - Otto's, done dead and gone
  - Otto Wood, why didn't you run
  - When the sheriff pulled out his Forty Four gun?
  - They put him in the pen, but it done no good
  - '''Cause it wouldn''t hold the man they called Otto Wood'
  - It wasn't very long 'til he slipped outside
  - Drawed a gun and the guard and says, "Take me for a ride"
  - The second time they caught him was a-way out West
  - In the hold-up game, he got shot through the breast
  - They brought him back, and when he got well
  - They locked him down in a dungeon cell
  - He was a man that they could not run
  - He always carried a Forty Four gun
  - He loved the women and he hated the law
  - And he just wouldn't take nobody's jaw
  - Otto, why didn't you run?
  - Otto's, done dead and gone
  - Otto Wood, why didn't you run
  - When the sheriff pulled out his Forty Four gun?
  - He rambled out West, and he rambled all around
  - He met two sheriffs in a Southern town
  - And the sheriff says, "Otto, step to the way
  - '''Cause I''ve been expecting you every day"'
  - He pulled out his gun, and then he said
  - '"If you make a crooked move, you both fall dead'
  - Crank up your car and take me out of town"
  - And a few minutes later he was graveyard bound
  - Otto, why didn't you run?
  - Otto's, done dead and gone
  - Otto Wood, why didn't you run
  - When the sheriff pulled out his Forty Four gun?

  - It was on last Christmas evening
  - The snow was on the ground
  - At his home in North Carolina
  - Where this murderer he was found
  - His name was Charlie Lawson
  - And he had a loving wife
  - But they never knew what caused him
  - To take his family's life
  - They say he killed his wife at first
  - And the little ones did cry
  - '"Please papa wont you spare our lives'
  - For it's so hard to die"
  - But the raging man could not be stopped
  - He would not heed their call
  - And kept on firing fatal shots
  - Until he'd killed them all
  - And when the sad sad news was heard
  - It was a great surprise
  - He killed six children and his wife
  - And then he tore their eyes
  - And now farewell kind friends and home
  - I'll see you all no more
  - Into my breast I'll fire one shot
  - Then my troubles will be o'er
  - They did not carry him to jail
  - No lawyers did he pay
  - He will have his trial in another land
  - On the final judgment day
  - They all were buried in a crowded grave
  - While the angels watched above
  - Come home, come home my little ones
  - To the land of peace and love

  - It's awful funny and it won't take long
  - About a crow in a hickory tree
  - One little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree
  - My gal took sick the other day
  - And the doctor said she's gonna pass away
  - I bought her a corset at the dry good store
  - She's in better shape now than she was before
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree
  - I bought me a suit of union underwear
  - To keep me from the cold and chilly air
  - I wore it six months without exaggeration
  - And I couldn't get it off 'cause I lost the combination
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree
  - I had a cow that had dressed in silk
  - She fell down and strained her milk
  - My wife went to milk, well she thought it was a cinch
  - To milk that cow with a monkey wrench
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree
  - On a cold winter night when I thought I'd freeze
  - The old white cow she froze her knee
  - Sneezed so hard she caught the croup
  - Her tail got stiff and she couldn't scoop
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree
  - Throw back the hook and pull back the line
  - The fish won't bite in the wintertime
  - Sittin' on the ice till my feet got cold
  - Watchin' the crawfish making his hole
  - Caw, caw, one little story that the crow told me
  - Caw, caw, in a hickory tree

  - We live in a political world
  - Love don't have any place
  - We're living in times where men commit crimes
  - And crime don't have a face
  - We live in a political world
  - Icicles hanging down
  - Wedding bells ring and angels sing
  - Clouds cover up the ground
  - We live in a political world
  - Wisdom is thrown into jail
  - It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
  - Leaving no one to pick up a trail
  - We live in a political world
  - Where mercy walks the plank
  - Life is in mirrors, death disappears
  - Up the steps into the nearest bank
  - We live in a political world
  - Where courage is a thing of the past
  - Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
  - The next day could be your last
  - We live in a political world
  - The one we can see and can feel
  - But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck
  - We all know for sure that it's real
  - We live in a political world
  - In the cities of lonesome fear
  - Little by little you turn in the middle
  - But you're never why you're here
  - We live in a political world
  - Under the microscope
  - You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
  - You always got more than enough rope
  - We live in a political world
  - Turning and a-thrashing about
  - As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
  - What looks like the easy way out
  - We live in a political world
  - Where peace is not welcome at all
  - It's turned away from the door to wander some more
  - Or put up against the wall
  - We live in apolitical world
  - Everything is hers or his
  - Climb into the frame and shout God's name
  - But you're never sure what it is

  - There's a man who's climbed a mountain
  - And he's calling out her name
  - And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
  - He calls again
  - He can think her there beside him
  - He can miss her just the same
  - He has missed her in the forest
  - While he showed her all the flowers
  - And the branches sang the chorus
  - As he climbed the scaley towers
  - Of a forest tree
  - While she was somewhere being free
  - There's a man who's sent a letter
  - And he's waiting for reply
  - He has asked her of her travels
  - Since the day they said goodbye
  - He writes "Wish you were beside me
  - We can make it if we try"
  - He has seen her at the office
  - With her name on all his papers
  - Through the sharing of the profits
  - He will find it hard to shake her
  - From his memory
  - And she's so busy being free
  - There's a lady in the city
  - And she thinks she loves them all
  - There's the one who's thinking of her
  - There's the one who sometimes calls
  - There's the one who writes her letters
  - With his facts and figures scrawl
  - She has brought them to her senses
  - They have laughed inside her laughter
  - Now she rallies her defenses
  - For she fears that one will ask her
  - For eternity
  - And she's so busy being free
  - There's a man who sends her medals
  - He is bleeding from the war
  - There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
  - There's a drummer and a dreamer
  - And you know there may be more
  - She will love them when she sees them
  - They will lose her if they follow
  - And she only means to please them
  - And her heart is full and hollow
  - Like a cactus tree
  - While she's so busy being free

  - Mama, sweet mama
  - Where are you going
  - With all your babies
  - And that casserole
  - I'm going to the jailhouse
  - In Camilla, Georgia
  - To see a woman
  - And ask for her parole
  - Mama, sweet mama
  - Why are you beaten
  - Why are your babies
  - Scattered on the ground
  - The sheriff slapped me
  - And then he struck me down
  - He kept on kicking
  - Till I blacked out
  - This old Georgia town
  - Knocked me from my feet
  - I see a blue-eyed devil
  - Looking down at me
  - Mama, sweet mama
  - Why did you do it
  - Why did you not move back
  - Into the crowd
  - Ella Mae was watching
  - From the jailhouse window
  - I had to show her
  - I was proud
  - This old Georgia town
  - Knocked me from my feet
  - I see a blue-eyed devil
  - Looking down at me
  - This old Georgia town
  - Knocked me from my feet
  - I see a blue-eyed devil
  - Looking down at me
  - Mama, sweet mama
  - What's happened to you
  - Your pregnant body
  - Standing so tough
  - My unborn baby
  - Is no longer
  - Now I'm a lawyer
  - Is that enough
  - Is that enough?

  - If I were to die tomorrow
  - At least we'd have tonight
  - Spend the hours knowing we're alive
  - Laughing under stars and running fields throughout the night
  - Amen and Amen
  - Pass the biscuits darling
  - This supper's heaven sent
  - You mean more than any fame and fortune I could find
  - And the Carolina Moon is rising in the Texas sky
  - To the blue of the canyon
  - I will love you my whole life
  - Autumn all yellow, rust and red
  - I'd trade seasons for time with you instead
  - Amen and Amen

  - This supper's heaven sent
  - You mean more than any fame and fortune I could find
  - And the Carolina Moon is rising in the Texas sky
  - So let's sing our hallelujahs
  - And we'll have our sit right down
  - Pass that corn and okra, black-eyed peas
  - Can I have more of those kisses from you please
  - Amen and Amen
  - Pass the biscuits darling

  - The western prairie stretches far away from home
  - Lose your troubles in the big sky
  - Thought I'd move along like the ranchers do
  - Stake a claim on a quiet space or two
  - Miles away, still I recall your face
  - And your lines
  - I once resided in a place
  - Where riverboats lined up the big muddy shore
  - Until I couldn't stand my sunny South anymore
  - Tonight I want to be a strong Colorado woman
  - I don't want to be your Mississippi girl
  - There are times I need you to hold on to
  - But this time I got to hold on by myself
  - I tumbled with the dustbowls
  - Across the Oklahoma plain
  - Headed westward towards the mountains and the rain
  - The meadow of the timberline
  - With your image still haunting my mind
  - Tonight I want to be a strong Colorado woman
  - I don't want to be your Mississippi girl
  - There are times I need you to hold on to
  - But this time I got to hold on by myself
  - Take me down
  - Take me down
  - Won't you please melt me down
  - But let me up
  - Help me up
  - I want back on my feet again
  - I'm going where the Rockies and the river collide
  - Formed like a woman stretched across the great divide
  - Far from the land I betrayed
  - And what would be the price if I stayed
  - Tonight I want to be a strong Colorado woman
  - I don't want to be your Mississippi girl
  - There are times I need you to hold on to
  - But this time I got to hold on by myself
  - By myself

  - I was on a Delta highway
  - Twilight rising from the road
  - Lightning shone on cotton fields
  - I drove through pink skies alone
  - Went to Lourdes and Santiago
  - Traveled down to New Orleans
  - Between pilgrims and les bons temps
  - Live the visions and the dreams
  - All this searching leads
  - Down such winding roads
  - Funny how the time goes
  - So far away from home
  - Climbed the Yellow Mountain
  - Held the sun in my hand
  - Worshipped the warriors
  - In tombs of ancient lands
  - Did not reach to the leper
  - Though she gave me a smile
  - I just played this old guitar
  - Amidst 1000 Chinese eyes
  - All this searching leads
  - Down such winding roads
  - Funny how the mind goes
  - So far away from home
  - Maybe on the midland prairies
  - We could chase the native tears
  - Or wander in the desert
  - In hopes of Tunis or Algiers
  - May the Moors next enchant me
  - Tall, dark friend I have known
  - But when on the Delta highway
  - I'll think of you and you alone
  - All this searching leads
  - Down such winding roads
  - Funny how the mind goes
  - So far away from home

  - No one will know
  - The words you said
  - No one
  - Leave it to me
  - To disappear, to move along
  - Nothing from the past
  - Will ever haunt me like you do
  - Oh, sweet baby
  - The devil made a mess out of you
  - Never say never
  - Thought I was wise when I loved you, dear
  - But some little boy
  - Needed a mama to hold him near
  - Wailing on the mourner's bench
  - Right behind the back row pew
  - Oh, sweet baby
  - Devil made a mess out of you
  - What's that spell
  - Makes us want to ride into hell
  - This much is true
  - He made a mess of me, too
  - I'll never forget the good times we had
  - Though you crossed them out
  - Then went back to the girl
  - You once sent away
  - Then you laughed about
  - There's a meanness inside you
  - That turns my insides black and blue

  - Now for the first time
  - The end is in sight
  - You give me your traditions
  - I'll hand off my ambitions

  - To feel like a fool
  - Or notice if they were watching you
  - Looking so good
  - In front of that mirror
  - But living in the back room
  - You begin to disappear
  - You change your name

  - The rush of the G's
  - We wear our special clothes
  - To keep the blood in our knees
  - Get a little me time at 76,000 feet
  - Serve my brothers, not the oil fields
  - Fight this war for peace, for peace
  - Until the job is done, until the job is done
  - Until the job is done, like my fathers before me
  - Do you have generals to train your brains
  - In the next life cycle we could all meet again
  - I write this romance for all the world to see
  - I post it on the Internet
  - But I do it just for me, just for me
  - May I draw you the sun, draw you the sun
  - May I draw you the sun
  - In the oldest living language, Chinese
  - I'm flying down to Texas
  - For a wedding at a ranch
  - To sing If I Needed You by Townes Van Zandt
  - For Mary and Peter, family and friends
  - To wish them all happiness
  - And joy that never ends, never ends
  - When two become one, two become one
  - Do two become one, like the twisting of the live oak trees
  - Our flight ends at DFW
  - And we say goodbye
  - I ride the trams and wonder
  - How airplanes fly
  - Dallas holds us for a moment
  - Then I ride on to Austin
  - Where I sit amongst strangers
  - And say nothing at all
  - Should old acquaintance be forgot
  - And never brought to mind?
  - Should old acquaintance be forgot
  - And old lang syne?
  - For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne
  - We'll take a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne
  - And surely you'll buy your pint cup and surely I'll buy mine
  - And we'll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne
  - We two have run about the slopes
  - And picked the daisies fine
  - But we've wandered many a weary foot
  - Since auld lang syne
  - We two have paddled in the stream
  - From morning sun till dine
  - But seas between us broad have roared
  - Since auld lang syne
  - And there's a hand my trusty friend
  - And give us a hand o' thine
  - And we'll take a right goodwill draught
  - For auld lang syne

  - A golden highway stretched out before me

  - With the lion and the lamb
  - And the beasts of the field
  - When your secret is revealed
  - When I lay my burden down
  - Could be tomorrow
  - God has not told me
  - And now I will love
  - With all the heart, soul and strength within me

  - Learned a little about many things
  - Our sweet potato cotton queen
  - Looks ahead when the whistles blow
  - A lady knows when it's time to go

  - Daddy taught her to never look twice
  - Say thank you ma'am and always look nice
  - Be the best like a football team
  - Scoring against the rivalry
  - And keep the insides hammered down
  - Best performer of the stage in town
  - A speck surrounded by soybean fields
  - In the land of red clay wheels
  - They say she'd tumble over the pews
  - Go sit with the preacher, too
  - Play flute from the choir loft
  - Sing alto and soprano parts
  - Gaze out at the back church wall
  - Stained-glass Jesus standing tall
  - Holding all of His little lambs
  - And the whole world in His hands
  - The boys eyed her through the rear-view mirror
  - Sucking two straws on Strawberry Hill
  - Driving back from a country bridge
  - Or throwing rocks from the water's edge
  - Now she's all packed up in parceled pillars
  - She's driving a U-Haul across the Mississippi River
  - Lanterns on the levee and a fist full of cotton

  - Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
  - There were few at the scene, but they all agree
  - That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
  - She walks these hills in a long, black veil
  - She visits my grave when the night winds wail
  - Nobody knows, nobody sees
  - Nobody knows but me
  - The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
  - If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
  - I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
  - For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
  - The scaffold was high and eternity near
  - She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
  - But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moans
  - In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

  - And his thank you, it melts all of us
  - The MGM Grand Could steal the heart of a man

  - I met you once in a living room in Jackson
  - Thought of you for six years or more
  - One hour, you were my secret standard
  - One night, you walked back through my door
  - Your lanky frame was not what I remembered
  - Waking from a long and fitful sleep
  - But after early morning conversation
  - I drove to north Texas in disbelief
  - That quaking in my heart was too deep for words
  - It tremored and it trembled and it ached
  - We spoke our peace out on the Golden Gate Bridge
  - And sealed it with a kiss under magnolias
  - Fortunes not made and not discovered
  - "There were mentors, we were prot\xE9g\xE9s"
  - From one rite of passage to another
  - We roughed through the wellsprings of our early days
  - Underneath that surface there was something
  - Only you and I could understand
  - I made my commitment to that long ago
  - Standing in the hallway down in Dixieland
  - Cause that quaking in my heart was too deep for words
  - It tremored and it trembled and it ached
  - We spoke our peace out on the Golden Gate Bridge
  - And sealed it with a kiss under magnolias
  - There's one thing I love more than Austin
  - Or curving round the Frio on her turquoise streets
  - It's your melancholy dread of Sunday evenings
  - Your shivering body when it sleeps
  - The future's looking stormy here before us
  - Wars, calamities and tribulations
  - We'll hatchet down the windows if we have to
  - And stand the watch together till the morning
  - Cause that quaking in my heart's too deep for words
  - It tremors and it trembles and it aches
  - We spoke our peace out on the Golden Gate Bridge
  - And sealed it with a kiss under magnolias

  - She rode shotgun in the back
  - We made snow angels in the motel tire tracks
  - The traffic thinned, it parted just for us
  - Through rain and wind, through ash and rust
  - We saw the white dome, like a gleaming breast
  - But our eyes were on the White House
  - And to hell with all the rest
  - The masses gathered drinking frozen margaritas
  - At the 8th and G Capitol Hill Cantinas
  - It goes like this
  - You take your hand
  - You lift it up and put it on your heart
  - And there you stand
  - Singing, "This land is your land, this land is my land"
  - A little body so packed with clothes
  - Disappearing into hordes
  - Lining up in useless rows
  - Of three million people
  - Ashamed and accused
  - Scared to say where they're from
  - Angry their name's been used
  - I held my girl as she fell asleep
  - At the noontime hour
  - At the inaugural weep
  - A man said to me, "you are living in the present moment"
  - And I felt shut out, cold, tired and all alone
  - It goes like this
  - You take your hand
  - You lift it up and put it on your heart
  - And there you stand
  - Singing, "This land is your land, this land is my land"
  - The privileged held while the masses flowed
  - Just like a mighty river running through my soul
  - My girl cried for a flag
  - Something she could understand
  - And we marched through the street
  - As I held her hand
  - The good days come
  - Not just the golden dies
  - As the giant sleeps under cumulus skies
  - We sing and dance and scream our names
  - Sleep the sleep of the weary
  - And drive home again
  - Honey, it goes like this
  - You take your hand
  - You lift it up and put it on your heart
  - And there you stand
  - Singing, "This land is your land, this land is my land"
  - It goes like this
  - You take your hand
  - You lift it up and put it on your heart
  - And there you stand
  - Singing, "This land is your land, this land is my land"

  - I never thought much/of that fancy dancin,
  - With my two left feet and my rovin eye.
  - But when the band plays so well/in that 3/4 time,
  - I could dance with my darlin/until mornin' comes.
  - Play me a fiddle tune, sing me a song.
  - Anish misfortune, my time is not long.
  - Midnight on the water/so steady and slow.
  - Stay up till the mornin/one more for the road.
  - Midnight on the water/so steady and slow.
  - Let's have another drink and set 'em up Joe.
  - Well, I've done all my dancin/ down in those barrooms.
  - Dancin and drinkin' go hand in glove.
  - So Give a beer to the fiddler, play all the old tunes
  - So I can dance closer to the one that I love.
  - Midnight on the water so steady and slow.
  - Lets have another drink and set 'em up Joe.
  - Hope this is it.

  - A little girl
  - A lust, a life
  - Hoping one day to be some man's wife
  - Early school mornings
  - Cold bathroom floor
  - You brushed my hair
  - And pushed me out the door
  - Oh, mama, you know I had to go
  - Before they up and covered me in that Mississippi snow
  - I miss the tall trees and sister's pine
  - Between the playhouse and the clothesline
  - And I remember driving home after your father passed
  - Thinking that night ride on 61 would be my last
  - Oh, mama, you know I had to go
  - Before they up and covered me in that Mississippi snow
  - I hear them singing In The Sweet By and By
  - And I Can Hear A Voice Calling from Heaven on High
  - Little baby born to take my place
  - Pastor are new peoples born to replace my race
  - Oh, mama, you know I had to go
  - Before they up and covered me in that Mississippi snow
  - Oh, mama, you know I had to go
  - Before they up and covered me in that Mississippi snow

  - Who was my mother
  - Who was my father
  - All I've known is a whip upon my back
  - My skin is yellowed by much more than weakness
  - And wise beyond the years of the blue and the black
  - My arms were never strong enough to stir molasses
  - My eyes watch riverboats as they go by
  - Some call me mistress, but I wish that I was cargo
  - Floating down the Brazos in that chariot to the sky
  - Oh Rachel, won't you lie next to me
  - Tonight and every night to come
  - And won't you calm all that's raging inside me
  - Cause outside's just a battlefield that Santa Ana won
  - My people, they worked from can't see to can't see
  - Traded in and out from the grassy shores
  - They say there's something about me
  - Flying like a bird
  - Never known freedom before
  - I wear dresses of silks and threaded satins
  - Some gowns were only meant to bear a woman's breast
  - I'll stand down every white man in this county
  - But Columbus, you are dying
  - And I'm no different from the rest
  - Oh Rachel, won't you lie next to me
  - Tonight and every night to come
  - And won't you calm all that's raging inside me
  - Cause outside's just a battlefield that Santa Ana won
  - I was born in the hills of Kentucky
  - But never native to the auction block arrest
  - Headed Southbound as a captive in this country
  - Just like the cowboys drove their cattle through the West
  - You can read all our names in the records
  - You can deny all the days as they go down
  - There's a brick-laid pathway calling you to find us
  - Underneath a golf course in an east Texas town
  - Oh Rachel, won't you lie next to me
  - Tonight and every night to come
  - And won't you calm all that's raging inside me
  - Cause outside's just a battlefield that Santa Ana won
  - Santa Ana won
  - Santa Ana won

  - I should have been ashamed
  - I should have been mortified
  - I should have hung my head
  - Dug me a hole and climbed inside
  - '''Cause I was able'
  - But the crumbs on the table kept me satisfied
  - No one should walk this path alone
  - My path of loneliness and shame
  - I thought my heart would turn to stone
  - Before our eyes, and with your blessing
  - What made me a martyr
  - What makes me your outcast
  - I just wanted to feel something
  - I should have been ashamed
  - I should have been mortified
  - I should have hung my head
  - Dug me a hole and climbed inside
  - '''Cause I was able'
  - But the crumbs on the table kept me satisfied
  - Hot off the press, come get the news
  - Right from the source of the scandal
  - About the dangers of the muse
  - And temptations too great to handle
  - What made me a martyr
  - What makes me your outcast
  - I just wanted to feel something
  - I just wanted to feel something
  - I should have been ashamed
  - I should have been mortified
  - I should have hung my head
  - Dug me a hole and climbed inside
  - '''Cause I was able'
  - But the crumbs on the table kept me satisfied
  - Do I sound mean
  - Do I sound rude
  - Do you think me petty
  - Think me cruel
  - Was I in love with you or you or you or you
  - I tried to be so true so true so true
  - I should have been ashamed
  - I should have been mortified
  - I should have hung my head
  - Dug me a hole and climbed inside
  - '''Cause I was able'
  - But the crumbs on the table kept me satisfied
  - And I should have been ashamed

  - Small town stars shine bright for a day
  - The moon lights up a watery grave
  - Woods move in the nighttime breeze
  - That lifts from the lake through the trees
  - On the night that defined my name
  - Fantasy or monster, you say
  - Watched my boys ride the incline down
  - All for a paper gown
  - Long ago I used to be
  - A little girl on my daddy's knee
  - Dreams lie like diamond rings
  - Babies and pretty things
  - I watched my car sink silently
  - My lover's sweatshirt wrapped around me
  - On a black man I blamed the crime
  - With moans and screams and cries
  - Then I waited for him to call
  - My ready-made family gone after all
  - While the world mourned an alibi
  - My hopes began to die
  - Long ago I used to be
  - A little girl on my daddy's knee
  - Dreams lie like diamond rings
  - Babies and pretty things
  - Day by day
  - All the promises faded away
  - No one but me
  - Controls my destiny
  - The sheriff sat me down to pray
  - At the First Baptist Church on the ninth day
  - '"Susan, make your conscience clean"'
  - '"Sheriff, I''ve done a terrible thing"'
  - I confessed that, for love's sake,
  - I drowned my children in John D. Long Lake
  - They're with Jesus, looking down
  - At me in this paper gown
  - Long ago I used to be
  - A little girl on my daddy's knee
  - Dreams lie like diamond rings
  - Babies and pretty things
  - Long ago I used to be
  - A little girl with dreams I believed
  - Dreams lie like diamond rings
  - Babies and pretty things

  - And wildwood wallpaper sloping down on me
  - Dreams of patent leather on a Saturday night
  - Wake up on Sunday with the birds at daylight
  - Who knows the voices in her head
  - A little bread and wine could raise her from the dead

  - Pillows frame the beams of a big brass bead
  - Pink felt heart on a blue ribbon
  - Hanging over her head
  - Fools deny that angels take us home
  - But you and me we got places to roam
  - She wears her cross like a tattoo

  - I don't know about heaven
  - But I put in my dollar
  - Let's see what it buys me

  - Wonder what they're wanting

  - Mister, what you show me
  - Don't think I'm not learning
  - Maybe it's my brother
  - Always tried to save us

  - He ain't good for nothing
  - I don't know about heaven
  - But I put in my dollar
  - Don't you try and stop me
  - Till I get where I'm going
  - Watching all the women
  - Making sense of living
  - All their little babies
  - Aren't we supposed to have them

  - Poem by William Butler Yeats
  - I went out to the hazel wood,
  - Because a fire was in my head,
  - And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
  - And hooked a berry to a thread;
  - And when white moths were on the wing,
  - And moth-like stars were flickering out,
  - I dropped the berry in a stream
  - And caught a little silver trout.
  - When I had laid it on the floor
  - I went to blow the fire a-flame,
  - But something rustled on the floor,
  - 'And some one called me by my name:'
  - It had become a glimmering girl
  - With apple blossom in her hair
  - Who called me by my name and ran
  - And faded through the brightening air.
  - Though I am old with wandering
  - Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
  - I will find out where she has gone,
  - And kiss her lips and take her hands;
  - And walk among long dappled grass,
  - And pluck till time and times are done
  - The silver apples of the moon,
  - The golden apples of the sun

  - Goodnight cottonlandia
  - Get your ghosts off of me
  - Grant captured Vicksburg
  - Sherman shot the hummingbird of the land
  - But slaves pull the sack across
  - The weight of this albatross in my hands

  - You're a pioneer
  - Headed for Newfoundland
  - Each land has his newfound joys
  - And pioneers must be big boys

  - And who your mama said you could be
  - Then there was me
  - Crying when I wasn't sad
  - Slouching in my shoes
  - Damning expectations
  - Because nothing here comes easy
  - In this stone cold world

  - And all of mankind stands there
  - Barely awake
  - A full moon rising
  - On all of nature's powers
  - Stars just observers
  - Of zinnias and moonflowers
  - We could bathe in the nullah of a gulf stream

  - Then transform like moths
  - In a chrysalis of light

  - And a Ford station wagon
  - So full of us it was dragging

  - And a walk down an aisle
  - He placed his hands on my head
  - And said "Bless you, my child"
  - Sweet chrism crossed
  - And incense burned
  - Throughout the ages Amen was heard
  - Are we fools who stay our fear
  - Declaring one desire most dear

  - No laughter left
  - The sun and moon have disappeared
  - Might some light enter here?

  - From the devil's claws
  - And then they saw the stars
  - From the center of the Earth
  - Or crashing through the atmosphere
  - The answer unclear
  - Though written in stone
  - I am afraid of the great unknown

  - When you are hidden from me
  - When I cannot feel the beating of my heart
  - Walk me where wild things grow
  - Where grace and light surround me
  - There I'll see my wild, wild rose
  - Ablaze in all her glory
  - Choosing what before I chose
  - The blessings of God's bounty
  - Light wraps you as you stand
  - Oh sacred stem in mortal flame
  - Great roots of night they grow
  - The things that hide come out again
  - Come to me my wild, wild rose
  - Ablaze in all your glory
  - Choosing what before I chose
  - The blessings of God's bounty

  - First of many flowers
  - Growing close behind the wall
  - Flax and seed, want and need
  - The wonder of it all
  - There's a place in that garden
  - We've both been there, darling
  - I won't forget
  - That day we met long ago
  - Woods of miles and acres
  - Winding through the hills
  - Moaning of the barnyard dogs
  - And barbed wire fences
  - There's a place in that countryside
  - You'll build a house so deep and wide
  - I can see the stones
  - The fires and thrones of long ago
  - Long ago
  - Rooms of abandoned houses in my mind
  - Long ago
  - Back porch living suits me fine
  - There were paints of blue and green
  - I was somewhere in between
  - Mama rings the dinner bell
  - Women and men
  - Move towards the sacred sound
  - Of a chiming metal wind
  - Daddy he flips a dime
  - How will we survive this time
  - Long ago
  - There were sharecropping farmers on the land
  - Long ago
  - All that's left are rusty nails in your hand
  - There were walls of yellow hue
  - Yeah, I learned a thing or two
  - The Trace winds 1000 ways
  - The Natchez drew it well
  - Their hallowed bones the native ones
  - Ours a merchants' trail
  - There are places in that road
  - Where lie the seeds we sowed
  - I won't forget
  - That day we met long ago
  - Long ago

  - You with the sad eyes
  - Don't be discouraged
  - Oh I realize
  - It's hard to take courage
  - In a world full of people
  - You can lose sight of it all
  - And the darkness inside you
  - Can make you feel so small
  - But I see your true colors
  - Shining through
  - I see your true colors
  - And that's why I love you
  - So don't be afraid to let them show
  - Your true colors
  - True colors are beautiful,
  - Like a rainbow
  - Show me a smile then,
  - Don't be unhappy, can't remember
  - When I last saw you laughing
  - If this world makes you crazy
  - And you've taken all you can bear
  - You call me up
  - Because you know I'll be there
  - And I'll see your true colors
  - Shining through
  - I see your true colors
  - And that's why I love you
  - So don't be afraid to let them show
  - Your true colors

  - In this stillness, this sadness
  - Hold my grieving, my madness
  - For a little while longer
  - Till I feel stronger
  - Love is closing down upon me
  - I did not know love before now
  - Here in the wilderness
  - I feel a tenderness
  - Where is my dwelling place
  - Wonder or longing
  - I want to stay with you
  - My place of belonging
  - Until you go
  - Death it surely comes to greet us
  - How can you be gone forever
  - Just when I learned you
  - And we embraced us
  - See his eyes and how he needs me
  - I'm an eagle set for soaring
  - O'er all of creation
  - As long as I'm able
  - Where is my dwelling place
  - Wonder or longing
  - I want to stay with you
  - My place of belonging
  - Until you go
  - Tracing old familiar paths
  - And bridges made for crossing
  - I have learned to say goodbye
  - Oh, what love has cost me
  - Then the rawness starts to fade out
  - And my thoughts glaze over nicely
  - Time is no healer
  - Pain makes me human
  - Come my love and let me hold you
  - We must fight to keep on living
  - For in a moment
  - Birds' wings are breaking
  - Where is my dwelling place
  - Wonder or longing
  - I want to stay with you
  - My place of belonging
  - Until you go

  - Hey there mama
  - Come and sit on my windowsill
  - I'll be your St. Francis
  - I'll be your whippoorwill
  - We'll sing together through the rolling glass
  - While your lover makes a nest that's built to last
  - These are the mornings of our past
  - I will watch your babies born
  - Not from a branch or a white magnolia bloom
  - But a farmhouse second-floor corner room
  - With pieces old and new
  - Borrowed and blue
  - Daddy watched his father play and arch top guitar
  - Him and Uncle Clint on the porch of a grocery store
  - Well I don't know but I've been told
  - They sang, "You get a line, I'll get a pole, sugar babe"
  - Hey there cousin
  - Won't you play dress up today
  - Or brother, slide down the stairs
  - Where mama threw her wedding bouquet
  - Mama, did you line them up and watch them fall
  - With a 22' waist and deep South drawl
  - I bet you charmed them all
  - Hey there sister
  - Won't you come sleep in my bed
  - We'll pull up all the blankets tight round our heads
  - And turn off the bedside table light
  - When I've closed my eyes and I'm sleeping tight
  - Don't want to stay up tonight
  - And we will wake up with the sun
  - And birds chirping from magnolia blooms
  - In our farmhouse second-floor corner room
  - With pieces old and new
  - Borrowed and blue

  - Went to the river
  - Came back wiser still
  - Only to see
  - You're as dear to me as the air I breathe
  - Won't you meet me at that mansion on the hill
  - Stuffed your mattress and wove your sheets
  - Patched your blanket piece by piece
  - If the Lord had granted me a choice
  - I'd a held up my hand
  - We ground the corn, molded lard and lye
  - Had ten children and watched four die
  - I'll stand beside you when you meet the promised land
  - Because I went up to the mountain
  - And I came back a wise woman
  - Went to the river
  - Came back wiser still
  - Only to see
  - You're as dear to me as the air I breathe
  - Won't you meet me at that mansion on the hill
  - Danced to the fiddle on a Saturday night
  - And chopped the cotton before daylight
  - The sun don't go down on a poor man's woes
  - But my love, if you don't meet the dawn
  - I promise you, I'll carry on
  - Singing Precious Memories as I plant along the rows
  - I went up to the mountain
  - And I came back a wise woman
  - Went to the river
  - Came back wiser still
  - Only to see
  - You're as dear to me as the air I breathe

  - Old Uncle Sam come down the road, tall and straight and slim
  - He had a shotgun in his hand and his face was hard and grim
  - His heels was kickin up the dust with every step he took
  - And when I asked him what was wrong his whiskers fairly shook
  - I ain't got time to talk says he, I'm in a powerful stew
  - So get your gun and come along, we've got a job to do
  - A varmint's hangin' 'round my house, sneaky dirty feller
  - And the stripes that's runnin' down his back ain't white in fact they's yeller
  - So get your gun and come along we're fixin to kill a skunk
  - We've done it before and we'll do it again and neighbor that's no bunk
  - Every one in the USA is sick of the little punk
  - So get your gun and come along we're fixin to kill a skunk
  - This varmint's had his way too long spreadin his aweful smell
  - And messin up a lotta homes where decent people dwell
  - But now he's gone a little too far, struttin and prancin about
  - '''Cause when he gets in my neighborhood brother he better look out'
  - I like my home the way it is and I like it more every day
  - And as long as I'm able to pack this gun, I'm goinna keep it that way
  - But I know how to deal with him, I've handled his kind before
  - It won't be fun, but the job'll be done and I'll nail his hide to the door
  - So get your gun and come along we've got a skunk to kill
  - We'll poke him outta the woodpile and chase him over the hill
  - When we get done with the son-of-a-gun he'll know he bit off a hunk
  - So get your gun and come along we're fixin to kill a skunk
  - I recollect one other time 20 some years ago
  - Another skunk come prowlin' around and at first I just let him go
  - I tried my best to leave him alone but he wore my patience thin
  - So I had to get my shotgun out and you know what happened to him
  - Well after that I kinda relaxed and laid my gun away
  - But now that smell has started again and it's gettin' worse every day
  - So here I am on the varmint's trail and neighbor I'm tellin' you
  - That skunk had better hunt a hole for him and all of his crew
  - So get your gun and come along we've got a skunk to skin
  - We'll grab his tail and give it a yank and pull it off over his chin
  - We'll chase him back to his dirty den and make it a pile of junk
  - So get your gun and come along we're fixin to kill a skunk

  - Dear Hitler, I'm writing this letter
  - Hoping you get it somewhere
  - I used to address you in Berlin
  - But now there's no post office there
  - I'm anxious to know how you're doing
  - And will it be much longer yet
  - '''Til you send the help that you promised'
  - '''Cause I''m gonna need all I can get'
  - You're great intuition should tell you
  - We'd better do something darn quick
  - I think I hear ancestors laughing
  - Oh Adolf, I really am sick
  - You told me the Yankees were lazy
  - And all too complacent to fight
  - You told me to strike at Pearl Harbor
  - And we'd rule the world overnight
  - But Yankees are very queer people
  - And we don't know just what to do
  - My soldiers call out, "Yank, surrender"
  - And they yell right back, "Nerts to you!"
  - There's one other problem that irks me
  - It's known as the B-Twenty-nine
  - And what do they mean by the eight ball
  - They say they have got us behind?
  - Please pardon me asking these questions
  - But I can't help wondering now
  - If you stayed too long in that beer hall
  - And miscalculated somehow?
  - You promised we'd meet in the White House
  - And oh, how I dreamed of that hour
  - But the Yanks have their own secret weapon
  - They call it the "Ike Eisenhower"
  - If I had just thirty years longer
  - I think I could whip Shiang Kai Shek
  - But this man MacArthur annoys me
  - Can't you take him off of my neck?
  - P.S., as you gaze in your crystal
  - To learn what the future will be
  - When Joe Stalin's face comes before you
  - Find out how he feels about me

  - It reached me where I'm holin' in
  - I don't have a Berlin post office
  - In fact there just ain't no Berlin
  - My keen intuition assures me
  - The great super race will survive
  - But please note this letter was written
  - On April Fool's Day, Forty-five
  - So if I should suffer reverses
  - And frankly I look for the worst
  - I'll hike to my fort in the mountains
  - If Himmler don't bump me off first
  - There once was a time when I figured
  - That I might hide out in Japan
  - But recently I have concluded
  - I'm much better off where I am
  - You're just like that guy Mussolini
  - You told me you really were tough
  - And then you start squawkin' your head off
  - As soon as the goin' gets rough
  - Why don't you review your great navy?
  - '''Twill boost your morale, I am sure'
  - Just borrow a suit from a diver
  - And you should have an interesting tour
  - I notice you mention the White House
  - And that durn near tore me in half
  - Too bad I can't find Hermann Goering
  - '''Cause he really needs a good laugh'
  - For many long years you've been itching
  - To bring the Yanks down to their knees
  - You say you hear ancestors laughing
  - But I think you hear the Chinese
  - That white horse that you ride so proudly
  - You'd better teach him how to race
  - You make a swell Lady Godiva
  - '''Cause you''re gonna lose more than your face'
  - P.S. I've cut off my mustache
  - So Stalin won't know who is who
  - I wish I could have my face lifted

  - I read it to my old friend Goering
  - And he darn near choked on his beer
  - It's hard for me to be writing
  - I've still got a very bad cold
  - I lost my shirt west of Moscow
  - That's quite a big town, I'm told

  - And here I am back in Berlin

  - Don't blame this on my Gestapo
  - You've had it coming for years
  - I recall your brave War Declaration
  - After France was laid on the shelf
  - That's when the 'Bronx cheers' started
  - I gave you a big one myself
  - Then I recall how you boasted
  - You'd give little Greece a smack
  - And there you got caught with your neck out
  - And you got your red ears pinned back
  - The lack of parades must hurt you
  - For I know how you love to strut
  - And I'm sorry your wardrobe is shabby
  - But we've all had to take a big cut
  - However, I'm sending some leather
  - And with it I give you this toast
  - Reinforce the seat of your britches
  - That's where you'll need it the most
  - My promise to give you Great Britain
  - Is a promise I'll never forget
  - I've sent Rudolf Hess to get it
  - But I haven't heard from him yet
  - P.S., I'm sorry, old Mussy
  - You didn't turn out so hot
  - But you may be sure I'll release you
  - Just as soon as I've grabbed all you got

  - The city sure ain't no place for a guy like me to end in
  - Goin' back to whur I come from
  - Whur the mockin' bird is singin' in the lilac bush
  - I used to go down to the station
  - Every evenin' just to watch the Pullman train come rollin' in
  - And then one night, that great temptation
  - Got the best of me and drove me to a life of sin
  - I took my hat and fourteen dollars
  - And I went through all the troubles of this life that always follers
  - When you're rich and huntin' romance
  - But my huntin' days are over, I can tell you that
  - I met a man in Kansas City
  - An' he winked at me and asked me if I'd like to step around
  - And I said, "Yup! that's what I'm here fer"
  - And he said he'd take me to the hottest spots in town
  - He mentioned things he'd have to fix up
  - So he took my fourteen dollars, but there must have been a mix-up
  - He's been gone since Thursday evenin'
  - And I've got a hunch I'll never see that guy no more
  - When I get old and have a grandson
  - I can tell him 'bout my romance and then watch his eyes bug out
  - But chances are he won't believe me
  - So he'll do the same darn thing when he's growed up, no doubt
  - But he can't say I didn't warn him
  - What will happen if he meets up with that city guy, goldarn him
  - I'm goin' back to whur I come from

  - In every conquered land where folks have waited and prayed
  - Millions of men with a song in their heart will join the big parade
  - The Dutch and Poles and Greeks, Norwegians and the Czechs
  - Will soon be swarmin' around Berlin and wringin' some Nazi necks
  - They'll hunt out every Hun and chase him down the road
  - And when he hollars comrade they'll give him the other load
  - It's just a matter of time till Hitler's bound to learn
  - The dream he had about rulin' the world ain't gonna work worth a durn

  - '''Cause millions of men are on his trail and they''re fixin'' to cook his goose'
  - Who does he think he is, this guy with a black mustache?
  - This world was made for decent folks, not for his kind of trash
  - Just like his pal in Rome, someday he'll swell up and burst
  - And we'll hang his hide on a hickory limb if the Russians don't get him first
  - It's just a matter of time till the boys'll come marching home
  - After they're through with the house-cleanin' job in Japan, Berlin, and Rome
  - Then what are we gonna do, let somebody start again?
  - To buildin' up a war machine to murder millions of men?
  - We can't go on this way with a war every twenty years
  - This world was made for somethin' else besides blood and toil and tears
  - We say it can't be helped, but it could if we were smart
  - If we're strong enough to win these wars let's stop'em before they start

  - It's a word I've been hearing quite often
  - And I know just how much it hurts
  - You've heard it yourself from the British
  - Dear Adolf, that word was 'Nertz!'
  - I'm writing again for a favour
  - Although I feel sure it's no use

  - Dear Adolf, oh please turn me loose
  - I'm longing so much for the old days
  - When they greeted me with 'Bravos'
  - And I like the old salute better
  - Without their thumb to their nose
  - Your Gestapo you sent here to help me
  - Don't know what a big shot I am
  - Please tell them their 'Bronx cheers' annoy me
  - And I don't like the way they say, "Scram!"
  - The last speech I made to my people
  - I outlined your Russian idea
  - And instead of the cheers I expected
  - I heard someone snicker, "Oh Yeah!"
  - Last night I dreamed I saw Stalin
  - And here's a suggestion he made
  - Better tell your dear old friend Adolf
  - To brush up on his wallpaper trade
  - And the next time that you see Max Schmeling
  - Here's something that he oughta know
  - The Yankees have got a new weapon
  - That's known as 'Brown Bomber' Joe

  - If we don't get busy and win this war we'll all be living on rice
  - The hands that rocked the cradle not too many years ago
  - Are working 24 hours a day for Willie, Jimmy, and Joe
  - Those boys are still her babies, don't think she'll ever forget
  - But Winston Churchill told us all about tears and toil and sweat
  - Us guys who're always complaining, what are we, men or mice?
  - What did we ever have to give up to compare to her sacrifice?
  - Ever hear her squaking about a spare tire for the car?
  - If it's inspiration we're needing, we don't have to look very far
  - Hey, hey, pull up our belts and grunt
  - Hey, hey, it's working, not talk we want
  - Hey, hey, we've all been asleep at the switch
  - And now we've got more scratching to do than a guy with a seven-year-itch
  - A lot of us guys who criticize the men in Washington
  - Suppose it was us running the show, I wonder what we would have done?
  - If nobody ever made a mistake in peacetime or in war
  - There'd be no need for that rubber mat around the cuspidor
  - The hands of our boys out yonder can only be filled by us
  - Are we letting'em down while we set around and squabble and squawk and fuss?
  - They're giving their lives for you and me, all right men, let's be fair
  - How much are they gettin' for what they give and how do our wages compare?
  - Hey, hey, we've all got a duty to do
  - Hey, hey, neighbor and capital too
  - Hey, hey, they'll be no profit and loss
  - And they'll be no five o'clock whistle to blow if we work for a Nazi boss

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Carson_Robison:The_Story_Of_Jitterbug_Joe
  - Let me tell ya 'bout a boy I know
  - The folks all called him Jitter-bug Joe
  - He was long and lean and thin
  - And he didn't have a lot of whiskers on his chin
  - His hair was slick as a horse's mane
  - It shone like a headlight on a train
  - Life to him was bo-do-dio
  - This kid called Jitter-bug Joe
  - His high school grades were awful
  - And they never did improve
  - But when it come to dancing
  - He could do the boogie woogie and be right in the groove
  - He took first prize at the county fair
  - For dancin' longer than anyone there
  - But he'd go to sleep on the end of a hoe
  - This kid called Jitter-bug Joe
  - The old town gossips shook their heads
  - And said, "My my, it's just too bad
  - Puts grease in his hair, the little brat
  - He'll never be nothin' but a durn happy-cat
  - Yeller tie and checkered socks
  - He sure is headin' right square for the rocks
  - If he was mine I'd lay down the rule
  - I'd send him to a reform school"
  - Then Joe left town one midnight
  - And they they all haw-haw
  - They smiled and smirked and whispered
  - '"He''s gone and done somethin'' and he''s dodgin'' the law"'
  - Just a bunch of buzzards lookin' smug
  - Another grave they thought they'd dug
  - But several things they did know
  - About the kid called Jitter-bug Joe
  - A year went by, and then one day
  - As the buzzards met in their usual way
  - To mull over gossip, old and new
  - A man walked up and said, "How do you do?"
  - Three bright stripes were on his arm
  - A medal was pinned on his uniform
  - His eyes were clear and his voice was low
  - It was Sergeant Jitter-bug Joe
  - Oh, you old gossip-mongers
  - Don't your tongues ever get in a cramp?
  - If it wasn't for kids just like Jitter-bug Joe
  - You'd be "heil-in' Hitler" in a concentration camp
  - They're out there fightin' while you sit around
  - With nothin' to do but run folks down
  - Take off your hats and bow down low
  - To kids like Jitter-bug Joe

  - There's a bridle hanging on the wall
  - And a saddle in a lonely stall
  - You ask me why the teardrops fall
  - It's that bridle hanging on the wall
  - There's a horseshoe nailed above the door
  - It's a shoe that my old pony wore
  - A faded blanket in the hall
  - And that bridle hanging on the wall
  - With that pony by my side
  - I used to ride
  - Down the trail
  - Watching the moon swing low
  - But now that faithful friend
  - Has found the end
  - Of his trail
  - He's gone where the good ponies go
  - And his bridle's hanging on the wall
  - And his saddle's in his empty stall
  - No more he'll answer to my call
  - There's a bridle hanging on the wall
  - And his bridle's hanging on the wall
  - And his saddle's in his empty stall
  - No more he'll answer to my call
  - There's a bridle hanging on the wall

  - I left my gal in the mountains I left her standing in the rain
  - I went down to the depot caught myself a midnight train
  - Made my way down to Georgia land it in a gambling town
  - Got myself in trouble 'cause I shot a county sheriff down
  - The jury read my verdict murder in the first degree
  - The judge said take that prisoner to the penitentiary
  - They put the handcuffs on me put me on the pullman train
  - Took me to Atlanta tied me to a ball and chain
  - I left my gal in the mountains I left her standing all alone
  - Last night I dreamed I got a letter saying baby won't you please come home
  - She told me that she loved me said that she loved me true
  - Then I dreamed I wrote a letter saying I'm a coming home to you
  - Then I awoke up this morning lyin' in Atlanta jail
  - No one here to love me no one to go my bail

  - Lots of things you oughta know
  - Take a tip from one who's travelled
  - And never stopped a-ramblin' 'round

  - Goin' to settle down for life
  - Then I heard the whistle blowin'
  - And I knew it was the Red Ball Train

  - And I never saw the gal again, boy
  - I never saw the gal again
  - Saw the gal again

  - I been from Maine to Califor'ny
  - And from Canada to Mexico
  - I never tried to save no money
  - And now I got no place to bo, boy
  - Now I got no place to go
  - Listen to a Boomer's story
  - Pay attention to what I say
  - Well, I hear another train a-comin'
  - Guess I'll be on my way
  - If you wanna do me a favor
  - When I lay me down and die
  - Just dig my grave beside the railroad
  - So I can hear the trains go by, boys

  - Come all you Texas Rangers, wherever you may be
  - I'll tell you of some troubles that happened unto me
  - My name is nothin' extra, so that I will not tell
  - And here's to all you Rangers, I'm sure I wish you well
  - '''Twas at the age of seventeen I joined the jolly band'
  - We marched from San Antonio down to the Rio Grande
  - Our captain he informed us, perhaps he thought it right
  - '"Before we reach the station, boys, we''ll surely have to fight"'
  - And when the bugle sounded, our captain gave command
  - '"To arms, to arms!" he shouted, "and by your horses stand!"'
  - We saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky
  - And then the thought it struck me, my time had come to die
  - I saw the Indians coming, I heard them give a yell
  - My feelings at that moment no tongue can tell
  - I saw their glittering lances, their arrows 'round me flew
  - And all my strength had left me, and all my courage too
  - We fought for nine hours fully, before the strife was o'er
  - The likes of dead and wounded I never saw before
  - And when the sun had risen, and the Indians they had fled
  - We loaded up our rifles, and counted up our dead
  - And all of us were wounded, our noble captain slain
  - The sun was shining sadly across the bloody plain
  - Sixteen of braver Rangers as ever rode the West
  - Were buried by their comrades with arrows in their breast
  - And now my song has ended; I guess I've sung enough
  - The life of any Ranger you see is very tough
  - And if you've have a mother that don't want you to roam
  - I advise you by experience, you'd better stay at home

  - Oh, the ragman draws circles
  - Up and down the block
  - I'd ask him what the matter was
  - But I know that he don't talk
  - And the ladies treat him kindly
  - And furnish him with tape
  - But deep inside his heart
  - I know he can't escape
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
  - With his pointed shoes and his bells
  - Speaking to some French girl
  - Who says she knows me well
  - And I would send a message
  - To find out if she's talked
  - But the post office has been stolen
  - And the mailbox is locked
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Mona tried to tell me
  - To stay away from the train line
  - She said that all the railroad men
  - Just drink up your blood like wine
  - An' I said, "Oh, I didn't know that
  - But then again, there's only one I've met
  - An' he just smoked my eyelids
  - An' punched my cigarette"
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Grandpa died last week
  - And now he's buried in the rocks
  - But everybody still talks about
  - How badly they were shocked
  - But me, I expected it to happen
  - I knew he'd lost control
  - When he built a fire on Main Street
  - And shot it full of holes
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Now the senator came down here
  - Showing ev'ryone his gun
  - Handing out free tickets
  - To the wedding of his son
  - An' me, I nearly got busted
  - An' wouldn't it be my luck
  - To get caught without a ticket
  - And be discovered beneath a truck
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Now the preacher looked so baffled
  - When I asked him why he dressed
  - With twenty pounds of headlines
  - Stapled to his chest
  - But he cursed me when I proved it to him
  - Then I whispered, "Not even you can hide
  - You see, you're just like me
  - I hope you're satisfied"
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Now the rainman gave me two cures
  - Then he said, "Jump right in"
  - The one was Texas medicine
  - And the other was just railroad gin
  - Like a fool I mixed them
  - An' it strangled up my mind
  - An' now people just get uglier
  - An' I have no sense of time
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - And Ruthie says come see her
  - In her honky-tonk lagoon
  - Where he can watch her waltz for free
  - '''Neath her Panamanian moon'
  - An' he says, "Aw come on now
  - You must know about my debutante"
  - An' she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need
  - But I know what you really want"
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again
  - Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
  - Where the neon madmen climb
  - They all fall there so perfectly
  - It all seems so well timed
  - An' here I sit so patiently
  - Waiting to find out what price
  - You have to pay to get out of
  - Going through all these things twice
  - Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?
  - To be stuck inside of Mobile
  - With the Memphis blues again

  - It was on an August morning about half past eight
  - Eight tobacco farmers had a very sad fate
  - When these men left home, their hopes were very high
  - They had no thought that they were soon to die
  - On a tobacco-laden truck there were twelve men
  - Eight of them were doomed never to see home again
  - They met their fate on a railroad track
  - These Deep Run farmers will never come back
  - Old number fourteen on the Seaboard Line
  - Roaring down the track, the engine running fine
  - The truck neared the crossing. The train they did not hear
  - They had no warning of a fate so near
  - Drove upon the track, there was an awful crash
  - Splint'ring of wood and a shatt'ring of glass
  - When the train had stopped, the trainmen ran back
  - Found those mangled bodies all along the railroad track
  - Lumberton people were horrified to hear
  - Of that terrible wreck that happened so near
  - Only four men who ever came back
  - Tell about the scene at the railroad track
  - In a Deep Run cemetery they were buried side by side
  - Bodies of those men who were killed on that ride
  - Four grief-stricken families mourn for the ones they love
  - They know they'll meet them in heaven above

  - Well, I'll tell you about the casket, my good friends
  - It would-a made your poor eyes pop
  - It was sterling silver all around and a real formica top
  - Formica top, it had a formica top
  - Well, I'll tell you about the widow, my good friends
  - The widow was in navy blue
  - With a gown designed by Balenciaga, I supplied that too
  - He sold the widow widow's weeds too
  - I held the first funereal raffle, though I don't much like to boast
  - And I gave away a Chevrolet to the person who cried the most
  - He gave away a brand new Chevrolet - I won it myself!
  - There were eighteen jugglers by the grave to demonstrate their art
  - And when they was done, I fired a gun to let the hootenanny start
  - He fired a gun and the hootenanny begun
  - I was serving beer and pretzels, till the hot pastrami came
  - And I sold some souvenir hankies with the dear departed's name
  - He was sellin' hankies with the dear departed's name
  - As a fitting finale we had the Rockettes from New York's Music Hall;
  - As you can see, my very good friends
  - All in all, all in all, all in all
  - It was a helluva funeral, I say one helluva funeral
  - No other burial could compare
  - It was all done up deluxe and I made forty thousand bucks

  - And he played low and dirty in the clutch, so what
  - And he never showed in Washington too much, so what
  - You're either a Congressman, or you're not
  - He was just a fellow looking for the kind of life
  - The average Congressman enjoys
  - Th worst thing you can say about old Adam C.
  - Is that he wanted to be one of the boys
  - He's a man the State Police would like to snare
  - And he flew his pals and buddies everywhere, so what
  - And he let old Uncle Sammy pay the fare, so what
  - You're either a Congressman, or you're not
  - With the ladies he's as handy can be, so what
  - And he digs that island magic frequently, so what
  - If he took a turn at cutting an LP, so what
  - You're either a Congressman, or you're not
  - When we think of how they punished him and threw him out
  - We say without a doubt, it just ain't right
  - We think what we've been seeing in them hallowed halls
  - Is a [?] of calls that [?] white
  - He's a man who often times is loud and brash, so what
  - He would rather eat a steak than cornbeef hash, so what
  - And while others kept the faith, he kept the catch
  - He was just a [?] tried to be like others in the pot
  - (?] Riggin' up like [?)
  - And skimmin' off like [?]

  - The question is, are the Africans and Africa prepared for independence?
  - Do they have enough delinquents among their juvenile descendants?
  - Can they fill their air with smog enough, their rivers with pollutions?
  - Are the citizens evolved enough for mental institutions?
  - Are they smart enough to know enough to regulate their taxes so the poor
  - Can pay the rich to keep the poor flat on their axes?
  - Do they know how to destroy what they produce for their enjoyment?
  - Or employ enough machines to keep employees from employment?
  - Have the natives the intelligence, the native wisdom, or the dexterity
  - To establish atom bases as the base of their prosperity?
  - In essence, have we morally the right to even plan to let the backward
  - Nations join the brotherhood of men?

  - As I walked out one May morning
  - To take a pleasant air
  - I saw a pretty girl walking by
  - With roses in her hair
  - I stepped right up and I said to her
  - Pretty girl, I think you're grand
  - She answered me and said, of course
  - I come from Ireland
  - I come from Ireland
  - That's very nice I'm sure, I said
  - You do the Country proud
  - But would you like to talke a walk
  - Somewhere behind the crowd
  - She said that was a pleasant thought
  - So we began to roam
  - And soon we reached a building grand
  - Where this girl made her home
  - Where his girl made her home
  - She asked me to take off my coat
  - And rest myself a while
  - She stepped into another room
  - Which caused me for to smile
  - She soon came back to where I sat
  - 'She didn''t keep me long '
  - And sitting down beside me said
  - I think I'll sing a song
  - I think I'll sing a song
  - And so this girl began to sing
  - In a voice both loud and clear
  - She sang of dear old Ireland
  - The Country she held dear
  - She sang me songs I had never heard
  - She learned from her mother
  - And when one song was finished
  - Well she'd start out with another
  - She'd start out with another
  - The hours went slipping quickly by
  - Till daylight all had gone
  - The night came all around us
  - And still she sang right on
  - And when the morning came at last
  - I said, I have to go
  - It's been a very pleasant time
  - And now this much I know
  - Ireland has leprechauns
  - She suffered many wrongs
  - Ireland has peat bog fires
  - And an awful lot of songs

  - No college days with Socrates and Plato
  - When you're Barry's boys
  - You just organize parades for the abolishment of NATO
  - And the rest
  - The entire West
  - So let's go back to the days when men were men
  - And start the First World War all over again
  - That's right you tell'em son

  - But she sails without a cabin boy the age of twelve and three
  - And she fears she will be taken by a Turkish enemy
  - As she sails on the lowland lowland low
  - Sails on the lowland sea

  - Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew
  - Green grow the lilacs, and green is their hue
  - Each lilac of green turns to one that is blue
  - Love, like the lilacs, can change colors too
  - I used to have a young love as soft as the snow
  - In springtime and summer together we'd go
  - It's sad to the heart when your love is untrue
  - Like the green lilacs when they turn into blue
  - I passed my love's window both early and late
  - The look that she gives me would make your heart ache
  - The look that she gives me was painful to see
  - My love loves another much better than me

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Chad_Mitchell_Trio:Hang_On_The_Bell,_Nellie
  - The scene was in the jailhouse, and if curfew rang that night
  - Nell's dad in number 13 cell would go out like a light
  - She knew her dad was innocent, so plucky Little Nell
  - She tied her tender torso to the clapper of the bell
  - Hang on the bell, Nellie, hang on the bell
  - Your poor daddy's locked in a cold prison cell
  - As you swing to the left, Nellie swing to the right
  - Remember that curfew bell must never ring tonight
  - It all started when sweet Nellie said, "No! No!" to Handsome Jack
  - And struggled for her virtue there down by the railroad track
  - Nell's dad came to her rescue as the train roared down the line
  - Jack fell back across the track and paid the price of crime
  - Nell's dad he got arrested, and brought up before the Law
  - 'The Sheriff said, "Old Handsome Jack ain''t handsome any more" '
  - 'Poor Nell she cried and pleaded, but the jury didn''t care '
  - They didn't have a sofa, so they offered him the chair
  - They pulled upon the bell rope, but there was no ting-a-ling
  - They could not get their foul deed done, for curfew would not ring
  - To and fro aloft swung Nell, while below they pulled and heaved
  - When suddenly a voice cried "Stop! Your daddy's been reprieved!"
  - They cut her fair young body down, while she made protests weak
  - 'And as they laid her out upon the ground, she cried in girlish pique:'
  - '"Look I tried to save my daddy, which was true a noble thing'
  - But still, while I was up there, man I learned it's fun to swing."
  - 'Hang on the bell, Nellie, hang on the bell '
  - So your poor daddy's sprung from his cold prison cell
  - As you swing to the left, Nellie swing to the right
  - No matter when that curfew rings, we're gonna swing tonight

  - And the folks I meet ain't always kind
  - Some are bad, some are good
  - Some have done the best they could

  - Just a-doing the best I can
  - Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
  - And the faces that I see
  - Are as worried as can be
  - And it ooks like they're a-wonderin' too
  - I had a buddy, way back home
  - But he started out to roam
  - And I hear he's out by Frisco Bay
  - And sometimes, when I've had a few
  - His voice comes singin' through
  - And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day
  - If you see me passin' by
  - And you sit and wonder why
  - And you wish that you were a rambler, too
  - Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor

  - Beds of flowers, pink and blue
  - Crowns of laurel, walls of ivy
  - Would you let me walk with you
  - If I gave you prides of lions
  - Teams of horses, two by two
  - And a school of flying fishes

  - A casket of jade, a cluster of pearls
  - A shower of stars for your curls
  - But I have no prides of lions
  - And my pearls, alas, are few
  - But for worlds of loving heartbeats
  - Would you let me stay with you
  - Love is a series of "darlings" and "dearies"
  - Of "honeys" and "sweeties" and sugared entreaties
  - Of moonings and swoonings, and cooings and billings
  - All tempered of course by occasional killings

    back again They know that what this country really needs is another movie star
    No one else can steal those leads like another movie star Ron Reagan is the governor,
    George Murphy in D.C. Now to complete the picture, all we need is Sandra Dee ''Cause
    bonny Ronny Reagan knows experience pays So California better get set for Death
    Valley Days Won''t it be great when we can say, "all the senate is a stage" Put
    politics where it belongs on the amusement page And though our next president

    the scene, Ringo''s next in line for Queen! Oh, gee, it''s nice to see the GOP
    With such a grand old plan They may not have a leader any more, but They''ve got
    a leading man And now we''ll be safe, for if someone slips And the finger on that
    little old red button was tripped Why, it simply wouldn''t matter, folks, it wasn''t
    in the script That''s why the country needs another movie star Now Lyndon is smarter
    and Hubert''s more clever But the GOP knows movies are better than ever So everybody
    sing, "the stars and stars forever..." [Spoken] Well after all George Murphy danced
    his way into the congress And Ronald Reagan acted his way into a governorship
    And George Hamilton... Well, he did the best he could ''Cause we need a movie,
    a groovy groovy movie Hey, don''t ya love a pretty movie star'

  - Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land
  - There are four generations of blood in this topsoil
  - Four generations of love on this farm
  - Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm
  - What are we making weapons for
  - Why keep on feeding the war machine
  - We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
  - Take it away from the hands of the poor
  - Tell me, what are we making weapons for
  - I had a son and my son was a soldier
  - He was so like my father, he was so much like me
  - To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be
  - He gave up his future to revolution
  - His life to a battle that just can't be won
  - For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun
  - I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad
  - The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold
  - I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old
  - What are we making weapons for
  - Why keep on feeding the war machine
  - We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
  - Take it away from the hands of the poor
  - Tell me, what are we making weapons for
  - For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner
  - A slave to the ways of the powers that be
  - And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see
  - Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other
  - What does it take for a people to learn
  - If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn
  - What are we making weapons for
  - Why keep on feeding the war machine
  - We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
  - Take it away from the hands of the poor
  - Tell me, what are we making weapons for
  - Have we forgotten all the lives that were given
  - All the vows that were taken saying never again
  - Now for the first time this could be the last time
  - If peace is our vision let us begin
  - Have we forgotten all the lives that were given

  - Well, they really kept her hoppin' on that busy afternoon
  - With both down and upstairs chopping while she hummed a rag-time tune
  - They really made her hustle and when all was said and done
  - She'd removed her mother's bustle when she wasn't wearing one
  - Oh you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
  - And then blame all the damage on the mice
  - No you can't chop your momma up in Massachusetts
  - That kind of thing just isn't very nice
  - Now it wasn't done for pleasure and it wasn't done for spite
  - And it wasn't done because the lady wasn't very bright
  - She'd always done the slightest thing that mom or pop had bid
  - They said, "Lizzie cut it out!" so that's exactly what she did

  - And then get dressed and go out for a walk
  - No, you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts
  - Massachusetts is a far cry from New York
  - No you can't chop your poppa up in Massachusetts

  - I just can't be beat
  - Well I'm a long tall Texan, I enforce justice for the law
  - He rides through Texas to enforce the law
  - I'm a long tall Texan, I enforce justice for the law
  - He rides through Texas to enforce the law

  - Hurrah, Hurrah, are you the law?
  - Yeah

  - Luci Baines, she is no Jackie, but then who complains
  - She may be tacky, but she is the brains behind our foreign policy
  - Who else but Luci could it be?
  - Lately she has grown addicted to the royal "we"
  - She tolerates no impropriety when Bobby Baker comes to tea
  - Guess who all was there on my date with Luci Baines?
  - 12 of Lynda's roommates
  - 11 live reporters
  - 10 Texas Rangers
  - 9 Supreme Court judges
  - 8 Stingray salesmen
  - 7 Secret Service
  - 6 geese a-laying
  - Lyndon B. himself...
  - 4 beagles
  - 3 congressmen
  - 2 Baptizing clergy
  - Luci Baines and me
  - Luci Baines, just like her pop, her popularity gains
  - She loves to sing out all those old refrains...
  - Oh, those TV towers of Texas belong to Mom and me
  - You'll find no Texas real estate in the name of Lyndon B...
  - The eyes of Bishop Pike are upon you
  - My pop can make you Thant say no
  - Pop said, "Tut-tut, we'll have to cut, deep in the heart of taxes..."
  - Luci Baines, let other girls indulge - my girl abstains
  - But you should see her on the backs of trains
  - Why, she stands ten feet tall
  - Oh, Lady Bird is sweet, and Lynda Bird's a tweet
  - But Luci Baines, you're the biggest bird of them all
  - Oh, what a bird...
  - Notes
  - 1. The "baptizing clergy" - Luci was baptized Episcopalian, but became a Roman
    Catholic as a teenager. She received "conditional" baptism from the Catholics,
    just in case the Episcopalian baptism was invalid for some reason. The Episcopalians
    objected. Maybe Bishop Pike was one of those objecting, but I thought Bishop Pike
    had other issues on his mind.
  - '2. TV Stations and real estate: there was something about Lady Bird and the daughters
    owning TV stations and other assets, so LBJ could appear to be "clean."'
  - 3. Burmese diplomat you Thant was Secretary General of the United Nations.
  - '4. Stingray Salesman: I think I recall seeing a photo of Luci driving a yellow
    Corvette Stingray convertible.'
  - 5. Bobby Baker was a political advisor to LBJ, investigated for questionable financial
    dealings.

  - Keep on truckin' mama, truckin' till the break of day

  - I remember down in Galveston,
  - When storm winds swept the town,
  - The high tide from the ocean, Lord,
  - Put water all around.
  - Wasn't that a mighty day? (A mighty day)
  - A mighty day. (A mighty day)
  - A mighty day, great God that morning
  - When the storm winds swept the town.
  - The winds began to blowin'.
  - The rains began to fall.
  - The lightning shafts were cracklin', Lord,
  - And the thunder started to roll.
  - The trumpets warned the people,
  - They better leave this place.
  - But never meant to leave there homes,
  - Till death was in their face.
  - The seas began to rollin'.
  - The ships they could not land
  - I heard a captain crying, God,
  - Please save this drowin' man.
  - The trains they all were loaded
  - With people leavin' town.
  - The tracks gave way to the ocean, Lord,
  - And the trains they went on down.
  - The waters like some river,
  - They went a-rushin' to and fro.
  - I seen my father drowin', God,
  - And I watched my mother go.
  - Now Death, your hands are icey.
  - You've got them on my knee.
  - You took away my mother now,
  - You're coming after me.
  - Repeat the last 3 lines of chorus.

  - I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
  - In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
  - I can hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
  - To your tambourine in time, I won't pay them any mind
  - It's just a shadow of my soul that I am chasin'
  - My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
  - And I have no one to meet
  - And that ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
  - In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
  - Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
  - All my senses have been stripped and my hands can't feel to grip
  - And my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
  - I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  - Until my own parade, I promise to go wanderin'
  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
  - I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
  - In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
  - Take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
  - Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the tremblin' leaves
  - And the haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
  - Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
  - Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
  - Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
  - Of a thousand distant lands
  - With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
  - Let me forget about today until tomorrow
  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
  - I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
  - Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me

  - Well my name is Willie Morgan, and I'm a hard-luck workin' man
  - The motto of my whole life has been, "Be as thrifty as you can"
  - I never use a US Air Mail stamp when a five-cent stamp'll do
  - And if you ask me for a dollar or two, well here's what I'll say to you
  - My name is Morgan, but ain't J. P.
  - Ain't got no banks in this World that are named for me
  - My money's in my pocket, not AT&T
  - My name is Morgan, but ain't J. P.
  - I said it's Morgan, but ain't J. P. (after last verse only)
  - Now I went down to grocery store just to pick up an item or two
  - I had no need for a grocery cart, just little paper bag would do
  - I had to wait for an hour or more just to get a chance to pay
  - The man added up a figure and he held in his hand, and I nearly fainted away
  - I took my gal to Broadway show that the whole town wanted to see
  - Well the taxi cost me eighty-five cents, it didn't mean a thing to me
  - I stepped up to that ticket booth and I laid my money down
  - When he said these seats'll be fifteen bucks, you could hear me all over this
    town
  - I went walkin' down Bleeker Street with my lady friend, her name was Sue
  - Keepin' her out of them fancy shops was about all that I could do
  - She squealed with joy at a marvelous toy in the window of an antique shop
  - When the little old lady quoted a price, I thought my heart would stop

  - In the early 1930s, the concentration camps of Germany began filling up with hundreds,
    then thousands, then hundreds of thousands of Hitler's political enemies.
  - These were the men who resisted the Nazi tyranny until they had to be destroyed.
    But they always dreamed of freedom, if not for themselves, then for their children.
  - Far and wide as the eye can wander
  - Heath and bog are everywhere
  - Not a bird sings out to cheer us
  - Trees are standing gaunt and bare

  - We are the Peat Bog Soldiers
  - We're marching with our spades to the bog
  - We are the Peat Bog Soldiers
  - We're marching with our spades to the bog
  - Up and down the guards are pacing
  - No one, no one, can go through
  - Flight would mean a sure death facing
  - Guns and barbed wire greet our view

  - But for us there is no complaining
  - Winter will in time be past
  - One day we shall cry rejoicing
  - '"Homeland dear, you''re mine at last"'

  - Queen Elinor was a sick woman
  - And afraid that she would die
  - When she sent for two friars from France
  - To come to her speedily
  - When the King he heard the Queen had sent
  - 'For friars from o''er the sea '
  - He called his noble Earl Marshal
  - To come to him speedily
  - Do you put on one friar's coat
  - And I'll put on another
  - And we shall to Queen Elinor go
  - One friar like another
  - Oh God forbid, said Earl Marshal
  - That such a thing would be
  - If I should beguile Madame the Queen
  - Then hanged I would be
  - And the King he swore upon his oath
  - His scepter and his crown
  - That whatsoever Queen Elinor said
  - He would not write it down
  - And thus attired they both did go
  - Till they came to Whitehall
  - The bells did ring, and the choristers sing
  - And the torches did light them all
  - Be you two friars of France, she said
  - As I suppose you be
  - But if you be two English friars
  - Then hanged thou wouldst be
  - We are two friars of France, they said
  - As you suppose we be
  - And we have not been at any mass
  - Since we came over the sea
  - The first vile sin that ere I did
  - To you I will unfold
  - Earl Marshal had my maidenhead
  - Underneath this cloth of gold
  - That is a vile sin, said the King
  - God may forgive it thee
  - Amen, amen, quoth Earl Marshal
  - With a heavy heavy heart spoke he
  - The next vile sin that ere I did
  - To you I'll not deny
  - I brewed a pot of poison strong
  - To poison King Henry
  - That is a vile sin, said the King
  - God may forgive it thee
  - Amen, amen, quoth Earl Marshal
  - I wish it so may be
  - Do you see yonder little child
  - A-tossing of that ball?
  - That is Earl Marshal son, she said
  - And I love him the best of all
  - And do you see yonder little boy
  - A-catching of that ball?
  - That is King Henry's son, she said
  - And I love him the worst of all
  - His head is like unto a bull
  - His nose is like a boar
  - No matter for that, King Henry said
  - I love him the better therefore
  - Then the King threw off his friar's coat
  - He appeared all in red
  - She shrieked, she cried, she wrung her hands
  - She said she was betrayed
  - And the King looked over his left shoulder
  - And a grim look looked at he
  - And he said, Earl Marshal, but for my oath
  - Then hanged you would be

  - We never eat cookies because they have yeast
  - And one little bite turns a man to a beast
  - Can you imagine a sadder disgrace
  - Then of a man in the gutter with crumbs on his face
  - Away, away with rum, by gum, rum, by gum, rum, by gum
  - Away, away with rum, by gum, the song of the Temperance Union
  - We never eat fruitcake because it has rum
  - And one little bite turns a man to a bum
  - Can you imagine a sorrier sight
  - Than a man eating fruitcake until he gets tight
  - We're coming, we're coming, our brave little band
  - On the right side of temperance we do take our stand
  - We don't use tobacco because we do think
  - That the people who use it are likely to drink
  - Away, away with rum, by gum, rum, by gum, rum, by gum
  - Away, away with rum, by gum, the song of the Temperance Union

  - Words by Ian Tyson
  - How come we can't talk to each other any more?
  - Why can't you see I'm changing too?
  - We've got by far too long to end it feeling wronged
  - And I still share too much with you
  - Just one great river always flowing to the sea
  - One single river rolling in eternity
  - Two nations in the land that lies along its shore
  - But just one river rolling free
  - How come you shut me out as if I wasn't there
  - What's this new bitterness you've found?
  - However wronged you were, however strong it hurt
  - It wasn't me that held you down.
  - Just one great river always flowing to the sea
  - One single river rolling in eternity
  - Two nations in the land that lies along its shore
  - But just one river rolling free
  - Why can't you understand I'm glad you're standing proud
  - I know you made it on your own
  - But in this pride you've earned, I thought you might have learned
  - That you don't have to stand alone
  - Lonely northern rivers come together till you see
  - One single river rolling in eternity
  - Two nations in the land that lies along its shore
  - But just one river, you and me

  - Well Stewball was a race horse
  - And he held a high head
  - And the mane on his foretop
  - Was as fine as silk thread
  - His bridle was silver
  - And his harness was gold
  - And the price on his saddle
  - Has never been told
  - Well I rode him in England
  - And I rode him in Spain
  - And I bet you five dollars
  - I'll ride him again
  - Now come all you gamblers
  - Wherever you are
  - And don't bet your money
  - On the little grey mare
  - 'Most likely she''ll stumble '
  - 'Most likely she''ll fall '
  - 'But you never will lose, boys '
  - On my noble Stewball
  - 'Well now they are riding '
  - '''Bout halfway around '
  - 'And the grey mare she stumbled '
  - And fell on the ground
  - And away out yonder
  - Way ahead of them all
  - Came a dancin' and prancin'
  - My noble Stewball
  - Came a dancin' and prancin'
  - My noble Stewball

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Chad_Mitchell_Trio:Stewball_And_Griselda
  - Come all you men of sportin' blood and listen to my story
  - '''Tis of the noble Stewball, a gallant racing pony'
  - '''Tis also of his rider, who brought ol'' Stewball over'
  - He's the diamond of the land and he rolls around in clover
  - Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
  - Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win
  - Oh, the horses they were all brought out with saddle, whip and bridle
  - The gentlemen did shout when they saw the gallant riders
  - And some did shout "Hooray!" and the air was filled with curses
  - On the mare, Griselda, the sportsmen lay their purses
  - Oh, the trumpet it did sound, and they shot off like an arrow
  - Ol' Stewball scarcely touched the ground, and the goin' it was narrow
  - Griselda passed him by, and the sportsmen all did holler
  - '"Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller"'
  - In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
  - '"I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin'' like a tiger"'
  - Up spoke the noble horse "Ride on, ride on, my master
  - We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster"
  - And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
  - He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
  - '"Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas'
  - And your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings"
  - Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
  - And both the horse and rider called for sherry-wine and brandy
  - They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
  - And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare
  - Modified chorus
  - Bet on Stewball and you might win
  - Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

  - Every Fall when the leaves turn brown
  - Friday evening rolls around
  - I sit down in my TV chair
  - And my face assumes a TV stare
  - Goodbye world, goodbye family
  - It's football time
  - It's highlight films of last week's games
  - Commercials starring big league names
  - Analysis of all the plays
  - Picking the winners for Saturday
  - Interviews with the stars
  - Interviews with the waterboy
  - Interviews with the fullback's grandmother
  - On Saturday it's do or die
  - For dear old Siwash will defy, the enemy to dim our stars
  - Who have their eyes on brand new cars
  - Thank God for scholarships
  - Thank God for alumni
  - Thank God for the School of Education
  - Now my poor wife has got it rough
  - '''Cause Saturdays would be enough'
  - But Sunday's a tale she knows too well
  - A double header in the NFL
  - She says I don't listen to her
  - Said she was going to Reno
  - Sounded to me like a new formation
  - Now half time shows with pretty girls
  - In little short skirts and long blond curls
  - But who's got time for majorettes
  - When NBC has got the Jets
  - And I just can't afford two sets
  - But don't fret Jets
  - With four hundred thousand dollars for Namath
  - And two hundred thousand for Huarte
  - You can spend them to death
  - The terminology is giving me fits
  - It's red-dogs, cornerbacks, double safety blitz
  - Jitterbugging, automatic, submarine, zip
  - Zig-out, down-and-out, collarbone, hip
  - Listen to the huddle
  - Hear the quarterback say
  - '"Tucker, just take that ball and run for your life'
  - It's your turn to be on instant replay"
  - Well, as I sat there sipping beer
  - A shoe came whistling by my ear
  - A bullet pass, I really mean it went right through the TV screen
  - My wife was laughing hysterically
  - I said "Don't worry honey,
  - I can have it fixed by next Saturday"

  - Now we'd like to tell you the story of probably the grandfather of all modern
    day psychoanalysts, the great Doctor Sigmund Freud.
  - Well, it started in Vienna not so many years ago
  - When not enough folks were getting sick
  - That a starving young physician tried to better his position
  - By discovering what made his patients tick
  - He forgot about sclerosis and invented the psychosis
  - And a hundred ways that sex could be enjoyed
  - He adopted as his credo "down repression up libido!"
  - And that was the start of Doctor Sigmund Freud
  - Well, Doctor Freud (Doctor Freud), oh Doctor Freud (Doctor Freud)
  - How we wish you had been differently employed
  - But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
  - Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud
  - Well, he analyzed the dreams of the teens and libertines
  - Substituted monologue for pills
  - He drew crowds just like Will Sadler, when along came Jung and Adler
  - And they said by God, there's gold in them darn' ills!
  - They encountered no resistance, when they served as Freud's assistants
  - As with ego and with id they deftly toyed
  - But instead of toting bedpans, they wore analytic deadpans
  - Those ambitious doctors Adler, Jung and Freud!
  - Well, Doctor Freud, (Doctor Freud), goes marching in (goes marching in?)
  - How we wish you had been differently employed
  - But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
  - Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud
  - Now the big three have departed, but not so the code the started
  - No, it's being carried on by a goodly band
  - And to trauma shock and more shock, someone's gone and added Rorschach
  - And the whole thing's got completely out of hand!
  - So old boys with double chinsies, and a thousand would-be Kinseys
  - They discuss it at the drop of a repression
  - And I wouldn't be complaining, but for all the loot I'm paying
  - Just to lie on someone's couch and say confession?
  - Well, Doctor Freud (cha cha cha), oh Doctor Freud (cha cha cha)
  - How we wish you had been differently employed
  - But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
  - Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud
  - (Soft)
  - But the set of circumstances still enhances the finances
  - (That was beautiful, fellas)
  - Of the followers of Doctor Sigmund Freud, cha cha cha

  - On the twenty third day of the month of June
  - In the year of '54
  - They signed us weary whaler men
  - To sail for Greenland's shore, brave boys,
  - To sail for Greenland's shore.
  - Our gallant ship her sails we set
  - For the icy Greenland ground.
  - Well, they said we'd take about a score or two a whale
  - Before we're six months bound, brave boys,
  - Before we're six months bound.
  - Oh, the lookout up in the crosstree stood
  - With a spyglass in his hand.
  - '"There''s a whale, there''s a whale, there''s a whale fish," he cried.'
  - '"She blows on every span, brave boys,'
  - She blows on every span."
  - The captain stood on the quarterdeck
  - With his eye to the icy sea.
  - '"Overhaul! Overhaul! Let your davit-tackles fall'
  - '"Put your boats on the water," cried he, brave boys,'
  - '"Put your boats on the water," cried he.'
  - Well, the boats got down and the crews aboard
  - And the whale was in full view.
  - And the bosun roared, "Put your backs to the oars,
  - And steer where the whale fish blew, brave boys,
  - And steer where the whale fish blew."
  - Brave boys,
  - '"And steer where the whale fish blew."'
  - Well, the harpoon struck and the line played out
  - And the whale gave a thunder with its tail.
  - And the boat capsized killing half a dozen men.
  - And we never did catch that whale, brave boys,
  - We never did catch that whale.
  - '"To lose those men," the captain said,'
  - '"Well, it grieves my heart full sore."'
  - But we knew the losing of that hundred barrel whale
  - Well, it grieved him ten times more, brave boys,
  - It grieved him ten times more.
  - Oh, Greenland is a dreadful place,
  - It's a place that's never green.
  - Where there's ice and snow, and the whale fishes blow.
  - And the daylight's seldom seen, brave boys,
  - The daylight's seldom seen.

  - And the song that they're playing is eerie
  - Fare ye well...
  - It's march down the stair, and line on the bay
  - Packs on your backs and the boats are away
  - Waiting your turn while the pipe and drum play
  - But the song that they're playing is eerie
  - Fare ye well...
  - The drummie is polished, the drummie is grand
  - He cannot be seen for his straps and his bands

  - Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a-goin' to school
  - And I'm working in a defense plant
  - I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies
  - But I think you gotta see
  - That if someone's gotta go over there
  - That someone isn't me
  - So have a ball Sarge, watch'em ball

  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Sol!)
  - There once was a senator Bill tried to bribe
  - So Bill had a wonderful notion
  - He sent him a yacht but that wasn't enough
  - So Billie boy threw in an ocean
  - Billie Sol Estes, we're proud of you mate
  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Billie!)
  - It's hombres like you that make Texas so great
  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Sol!)
  - B is for the billions he's been bilkin'
  - I is to indemnify his loss
  - L is for the loans from Uncle Sammy
  - Then double L just like in double cross
  - I is for the interest he's accruin'
  - E is for the eggheads he outsmarts
  - Put them all together, you've got Billie Sol
  - 'Whose initials are emblazed on our hearts:'
  - Billie Sol Estes, we're proud of you boy
  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Billie!)
  - Next to you Jimmy Hoffa is Lord Fauntleroy
  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Sol!)
  - Now they're gonna take Billie away to the clink
  - And the way things look now it appears
  - For all of the wheelin' and dealin' he's done
  - He'll get three thousand four hundred years
  - 'Counterpoint:'
  - And the day they lead old Billie away
  - Why, each Texan will take off his hat
  - For who but a Texan
  - In all this wide world
  - Could pull down a sentence like that?
  - Billie Sol Estes, you're really a doll
  - (Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Billie Billie!)
  - There's Houston - and Crockett -
  - And now Billie Sol
  - Hey Billie Billie, hey Billie Sol Estes

  - Oh we're meeting at the courthouse at eight o'clock tonight
  - You just come in the door and take the first turn to the right
  - Be careful when you get there, we'd hate to be bereft
  - But we're taking down the names of everybody turning left
  - Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
  - Here to save our country from a communistic plot
  - Join the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks
  - To get this movement started, we need lots of tools and cranks
  - Now there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch
  - We think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much
  - We only hail the hero from whom we got our name
  - We're not sure what he did, but he's our hero all the same
  - Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
  - Socialism is the ism dismalist of all
  - Join the John Birch Society, there's so much to do
  - Have you heard they're serving vodka at the W.C.T.U.
  - Well you've heard about the agents that we've already named
  - Well M.C.A. has agents that are flatly unashamed
  - We're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinky Lee
  - And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
  - Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
  - Norman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along
  - But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
  - He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means
  - We'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks
  - For even Jasper Junction is just full of Bolsheviks
  - The CIA's subversive and so's the FCC
  - There's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee
  - Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
  - Here to save our country from a Communistic plot
  - Join the John Birch Society, holding off the Reds
  - We'll use our hands and hearts, and if we must, we'll use our heads
  - O beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain
  - Do you want Justice Warren to be your Commissar?
  - Do you want Mrs. Khrushchev in there with the DAR?
  - You cannot trust your neighbors, or even next-of-kin
  - If mommy is a Commie then you gotta turn her in
  - Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
  - Fighting for the right to fight the right fight for the right
  - Join the John Birch Society, as we're marching on
  - We'll all be glad to see you when we're meeting in the John
  - In the John, in the John Birch Society

  - When I was just a wee little lad full of health and joy
  - My father homeward came one night and gave to me a toy
  - A wonder to behold it was, with many colors bright
  - And the moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight
  - 'It went '
  - ' when it moved, '
  - ' when it stopped'
  - ' when it stood still, I never knew just what it was'
  - And I guess I never will
  - The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise
  - For right on its bottom were two big button that looked like big green eyes
  - I first pushed one and then the other, then I twisted its lid
  - And when I set it down again here is what it did
  - 'It went '
  - ' when it moved, '
  - ' when it stopped'
  - ' when it stood still, I never knew just what it was'
  - And I guess I never will
  - It first marched left, then marched right, then marched under a chair
  - And when I looked where it had gone it wasn't even there
  - I started to cry and my daddy laughed for he knew that I would find
  - When I turned around my marvelous toy chugging from behind
  - 'It went '
  - ' when it moved, '
  - ' when it stopped'
  - ' when it stood still, I never knew just what it was'
  - And I guess I never will
  - Now the years have gone by too quickly it seems, I have my own little boy
  - And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy
  - His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, he gave a squeal of glee
  - Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me
  - 'It still goes '
  - ' when it moves, '
  - ' when it stops'
  - 'And '
  - ' when it stands still, I never knew just what it was'
  - And I guess I never will
  - I never knew just what it was
  - And I guess I never will

  - All over this great big city
  - Can't find a woman who's nice and pretty
  - They all look like page in a magazine
  - Legs are long and they eat like a sparrow
  - Figures stick to the straight and narrow
  - Top and the bottom are same as in between
  - Show me a pretty little number
  - When she walks it rolls like thunder
  - Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
  - Round right here and round right there
  - Pretty red lips and her very own hair
  - Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me
  - Way down in a coffeehouse palace
  - Found a little lady and her name was Alice
  - She had friends and her friends had her it seems
  - Face was dirty and her sweater was baggy
  - Pants were tight and her hair was shaggy
  - I've seen her kind on college football teams
  - Well way up at a penthouse pretty
  - Thirteen miles up above the city
  - I met a little lady from a wealthy family
  - Now she could cuss like a real longshoreman
  - She was making eyes at the doorman
  - She made a most unusual offer to me
  - Way up at a Broadway party
  - I met a lady, she was very arty
  - She took me home to see her studio
  - She took out her paints and she whispered to me
  - She said that she wanted to "do" me
  - Some of that paint will never come off, I know

  - Well Eileen Orr, that's what me darlin's name is
  - O'er the Barony her features they are famous
  - And if we loved her, who was there to blame us
  - For wasn't she the Pride of Petrovar?
  - But her beauty was like to make you shy
  - Not a livin' boy could look her in the eye
  - Boys O boys! now here's the reason why
  - We're in love with the Pride of Petrovar
  - Eileen Orr, me heart is turning gray
  - Ever since the day you wandered far away.
  - Eileen Orr, there's more fish in the sea,
  - But there's none just like the Pride of Petrovar.
  - Well it was Friday at the fair at Ballintubber
  - Eileen met McGraw, the old horse trader
  - And I'd like to put me hands upon that robber
  - He stole away the Pride of Petrovar
  - Well he never seemed to see her standing there at all
  - Even when she ogled him from underneath her shawl
  - He was big and masterful and she was quick and small
  - Most provokin' to the Pride of Petrovar
  - Well, as it is, it was in the beginning
  - Eileen's heart was set upon the winning
  - And to see McGraw contentedly a grinning
  - To be courted by the Pride of Petrovar
  - Says he, 'I know a girl that would knock you into fits'
  - At this our Eileen nearly lost her wits
  - The outcome of the whole thing is that now the robber sits
  - With his arms around the Pride of Petrovar.
  - Well, argh me boys, with fate 'tis hard to grapple
  - Of all those girls, our Eileen was the apple
  - To see McGraw a walking toward the chapel
  - Arm and arm with the Pride of Petrovar
  - Well all I have is just one thing to say
  - If you go a courtin', then look the other way
  - If you want them to come after you, just look the other way
  - For they're all just like the Pride of Petrovar
  - Notes
  - Eileen Orr - Anglicized version of the Gaelic "Eileen Oge", meaning "Eileen the
    younger"
  - 'Petrovar - Anglicized version of the Gaelic Pedar-a-Vore, a place name. This
    name appears on an 1836 Ordnance Map viewable here:'

  - Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
  - Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and of fame
  - She flew the Stars and Stripes of the Land of the Free
  - But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea
  - Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
  - Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James
  - What were their names, tell me what were their names
  - Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James
  - One hundred men went down to that dark and watery grave
  - When that good ship was sunk only forty four were saved
  - Twas the last day of October that we saved the forty four
  - From those dark icy waters by the cold Iceland shore
  - It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
  - That we watched for a U-boat and waited for a fight
  - Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roar
  - And they laid the Reuben James on the cold ocean floor
  - Well, many years have passed since those brave men are gone
  - And those cold icy waters are still and they're calm
  - Many years have passed but still I wonder why
  - The worst of men must fight and the best of men must die

  - And he married a lady six feet 'round
  - She baked good bread and she baked it well
  - But she baked it harder than the hobs in Hell
  - The new foreman was Jim McCann
  - By God he was a blamed mean man
  - Last week a premature blast went off
  - A mile in the air went big Jim Goff

  - There once was a lawyer they called Mr Clay
  - He had but two clients and they wouldn't pay
  - At last, of starvation, he grew so afraid
  - That he courted and married a wealthy old maid
  - At the wedding the lawyer made one big mistake
  - '''Twas not in omitting the wine or the cake'
  - The ring was well chosen, they had a big feed
  - But the lawyer did not get a warranty deed
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man
  - At night in their chamber the lady arose
  - And began to prepare to retire and repose
  - Her husband sat near her admiring her charms
  - That gave him such pleasure to hold in his arms
  - She went to the washstand to bathe her fair face
  - And thus she destroyed all her beauty and grace
  - The rose on her cheek quickly grew very faint
  - And he saw on the towel, 'twas nothing but paint
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man
  - She went to the mirror to take down her hair
  - And when she had done so, her scalp was all bare
  - Said she, don't be frightened to see my bald head
  - I'll put on my cap when I get into bed
  - She hung her false hair on the wall on a peg
  - Then she proceeded to take off her leg
  - Her trembling husband got quite a surprise
  - When she asked him to come and take out her glass eye
  - Now all you young men who would marry for life
  - Be sure to examine your intended wife
  - Remember the lawyer who trusted his eyes
  - And a little bit later got quite a surprise
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man
  - He's a very unfortunate, very unfortunate, very unfortunate man

  - Well now friends you'll never guess it, so I really must confess it
  - I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
  - But a friend of mine said, "Buddy, just in case your mind is muddy
  - Don't you know that girl you're fooling with is Peg-leg Johnson's wife
  - And that man is big and tough and mean and grim
  - And he'll brain you with his artificial limb"
  - But next morning bright and early, I stole old Peg-leg's girlie
  - And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
  - But there weren't no time for laughter, 'cause he started hopping after
  - And I keep on running faster, but he won't give up the chase
  - And I'm running through the mountains with his bride
  - And I got his wooden leg here by my side
  - I'm a three legged man with a two-legged woman
  - Being chased cross the country by a one-legged fool
  - Though he's huffing and he's puffing and he shows no sign of stopping
  - I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel
  - '''Cross the deserts and the valleys and those dark Chicago alleys'
  - '''Cross the mighty Mississippi to the hills of Caroline'
  - Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
  - Every time that I look back, he's just one foot behind
  - And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
  - But in spite of all his woes he can kick
  - Now he's ragged and he's filthy and I'm feeling kinda guilty
  - '''Specially in the evening when I hear him plead and beg'
  - He says, "Spite of all your stealing friend, I bear you no hard feeling
  - You can keep the derned old woman, but please give me back my leg"
  - For although the one you meant to take was wooden
  - In the dark by mistake you took my good'un

  - To bring you dappled, diamond crowns
  - And climb your tower, Sleeping Beauty

  - The press was full of lies about us, preacher told us we were right
  - The outside agitators came, they burned some churches and they put the blame

- - http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Chad_Mitchell_Trio:What_Kind_Of_Life_Is_That
  - When I think of Elizabeth Taylor
  - And many's the times I do
  - I think what that poor kid puts up with
  - And it tears my heart in two
  - She's out every night in a swank cabaret
  - Gets breakfast in bed on a solid gold tray
  - I hear that she earns seven thousand a day
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - She gets what she wants regardless* of price
  - Yeah, "Did you see her ring, that was some chunk of ice?"
  - Why, she has thirty minks that she's never worn twice
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - What kind of life, what kind of life, what kind of life is that?
  - Facing snakes and other dangers
  - Making love to perfect strangers
  - I read in the news she buys booze by the vat
  - Now, "What kind of life is that"?
  - Poor Liz, poor Liz
  - Does she know what it means to make a pot roast last a week
  - To wrap a towel around a pipe in case it springs a leak
  - Does she know what it means to get down on her hands and knees
  - To wash her kid's pajamas or her old man's BVDs?
  - These simple pleasures don't delight her
  - She's too busy with la dolce viter*
  - Wherever she goes something thrilling occurs
  - She goes out to dine and the restaurant stirs
  - She's had twenty husbands, yeah, "Five of them hers!"
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - I'm sure Liz must think things look dandy so far
  - But will she, like poor Sybil*, one day wear a scar
  - Will she wind up too with a rock-and-roll star
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - What kind of life, what kind of life, what kind of life is that?
  - At MGM they silver-spooned her
  - I think 'National Velvet'* ruined her
  - I pay for a house what she pays for hat
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - They packed up the crew at the Fox Studio
  - They headed for Egypt, but Nasser* said, "No"
  - They wouldn't let her in, she's Jewish, you know
  - '"What kind of life is that"?'
  - So for all of her glamour and her whoop-tee-doo
  - And her house in the best neighborhood
  - Would you take that lousy life if it was offered to you
  - You can bet Cleopatra's asp, you would!
  - Notes
  - 1. "regardless" - grammatically incorrect, but it is the actual word used. Substitute
    "irrespective" if you're a purist.
  - 2. la dolce viter - a play on words on "la dolce vita" (Italian for, "the sweet
    life") in order to rhyme with the preceding line.
  - 3. Sybil - Sybil, Richard Burton's 1st wife
  - 4. National Velvet - The 1944 film that skyrocketed Elizabeth Taylor to stardom
    at age 12.
  - 5. Nasser - Gamal Abdul Nasser, president of Egypt 1956 - 1970.

  - Which Hat Shall I Wear? - Chad Mitchell Trio
  - Which hat shall I wear, the red one or blue one?
  - Which hat shall I wear to the PTA?
  - The red hat's becoming; the blue one's a new one.
  - Mary, come here. Tell me which do you say?
  - This afternoon's meeting of our PTA
  - Is certain to be well attended
  - For we are protesting the ruling today
  - Of the way separate schools will be ended.
  - Now Mary, you've worked for me over a year.
  - By now you must certainly know
  - That I'm very fond of your people, my dear,
  - And I don't mind telling you so.
  - I think it's a pity my Jimmy can't be
  - In school with his darker skinned brothers.
  - With school integration I fully agree,
  - And so do the rest of the mothers.
  - But my little Jimmy is really too small
  - To ride to your school on a bus.
  - And frankly, your people aren't helping at all.
  - Oh, why must there be such a fuss!
  - Oh dear, I must hurry and be on my way.
  - There's never a time for relaxing.
  - Mary, the windows need washing today
  - And the hall and the foyer need waxing.
  - I've left some dresses piled up on a chair,
  - The cleaner is coming at two.
  - Don't let him take the green silk with a tear.
  - That one, my dear, is for you.

  - Golden curls run down his neck
  - The fairiest ever seen
  - His true love was the prettiest thing
  - In all the countryside
  - And after Willy courted her
  - She swore to be his bride
  - He had no gold to give her dad
  - No gold to buy them land
  - And in his haste to wed his love
  - He joined an outlaw band
  - They ravaged all the countryside
  - Their fortune for to gain
  - Until one cold and windy day
  - They robbed the Fresco train
  - The train guard lost his life that day
  - But just before he died
  - He fired a deadly pistol ball
  - In Willy Seton's side
  - His comrades they deserted him
  - And left him all alone
  - And holding tightly to his side
  - He started out for home
  - He had not travelled many a mile
  - Until a storm came on
  - And Willy Seton found a log
  - To set himself upon
  - He leaned his back against the tree
  - And held onto his side
  - And in that cold and snowy wood
  - Young Willy Seton died
  - He was sixteen when he loved
  - Sixteen when he cried

  - When God's on your side
  - When the Second World War
  - Came to an end
  - We forgave the Germans
  - And then we were friends
  - Though they murdered six million
  - In the ovens they fried
  - The Germans now too
  - Have God on their side
  - But now we got weapons
  - Of the chemical dust
  - If fire them we're forced to
  - Then fire them we must

  - If not, then why not have us down? (Have us down)
  - You'll never recognize us, there's a smile upon our face
  - We're changin' all our dirty sheets and a-cleanin' up the place
  - Yep, since we got a lawyer and a public relations man
  - We're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
  - Yes, we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
  - Ever since we got that lawyer and that public relations man
  - '''Cause we did shoot one reporter, but he was just obscene'
  - And you can't call us no filthy names - What does Anglo-Saxon mean?
  - Allemande left, allemande right, the Ladies' Auxiliary is meetin' tonight
  - '''Cause the Klan''s collected so much cash that now, by gum, we''re rich white
    trash!'
  - Now, we've heard it said our leadership's not qualified to lead
  - Well I'm tellin' you that just ain't true - Why three of them can read
  - Take our Grand Exalted Dragon, now some folks think he's bad
  - Well, you should meet his sweet old mother, and her brother, who's his dad
  - Yes, they're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
  - And he's gonna run for governor soon as he's out of the can
  - We're all from fine old families, the pride of all these hills
  - Yep, seven generations at the same old illegal stills
  - Had a little rally the other night, shot up town in a fury
  - Luke's arrested, Pa's on trial, and the rest of us are on the jury
  - Now, we've heard them call us deadbeats, and we'd like to say we're not
  - We'll all stand on our record, and that's one thing we've all got
  - And we only have that arsenal so that you won't raise no fuss
  - And if you don't like that, then call the cops, 'cause the chances are, they're
    us
  - Yes we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
  - But somehow we went from the fire to the fryin' pan
  - We never learned to hold a job, and we never learned to write
  - But boy, we sure have learned the ropes, 'cause we use them every night
  - Now, when Congress calls you, don't get stuck, just start confessin' and pass
    the buck
  - The Kludd blames the Klaxon, the Klaxon blames the Kleagle, the Kleagle blames
    the Grand Imperial Eagle
  - The Eagle blames the Wizard, the Wizard blames the Dragon, the Dragon takes the
    blame, but he's just braggin'
  - Now, we're out to show the Congress that we're all so nice and meek
  - Why we never even take the Fifth, 'cause we drank that all last week
  - And you'll never hear us shootin' or hangin' people high
  - '''Cause we''re learnin'' to respect the law and to have an alibi'
  - Oh, come, come, come, come
  - Come to the church in the wildwood
  - Oh come to the church in the vale
  - No spot is so dear to my childhood...
  - And, those dirty, lyin' witnesses, Lord, forgive them what they speak
  - We would go to church and pray for them... 'cept we blew it up last week
  - Yes, we're your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux-Klan
  - And we sure do thank that lawyer and that public relations man
  - So we're sorry that we hung them, but they did have quite a tan
  - And it sure confused your friendly, liberal, misunderstood

  - Your friendly, liberal, neighborhood Ku-Klux
  - Grab your Cadillac and head for the hills

  - He laughs upon point duty
  - He laughs upon his beat
  - He laughs at everybody
  - When he's walking in the street
  - He never can stop laughing
  - He says he's never tried
  - But once he did arrest a man
  - And laughed until he cried
  - His jolly face is wrinkled
  - And then he shut his eyes
  - He opened his great big mouth
  - It was a wonderous size
  - 'He said: "I must arrest you!"'
  - He didn't know what for
  - And then he started laughing
  - Until he cracked his jaw
  - So if you chance to meet him
  - While walking 'round the town

  - Says to me, man, what else can I do
  - Oh, he bounced to me as he opened the door
  - Says, thank you sir, come back some more
  - That's Shorty the barber, he's the top
  - When he bops the boogie woogie on the razor's strop
  - Snap from the scissors
  - A blow from his comb, olee-aye olee-aye
  - Sounds just like a saxophone
  - 'spoken: Says Shorty play that thing some more let me hear ya'
  - 'Oh man play that stomp, chop of that ..? I know you can do it '
  - Snap from the scissors
  - A blow from his comb, olee-aye olee-aye
  - Sounds just like a trambone

  - And all the fellows look you up and down

  - Get it from the front, roo doo dee-da
  - The only thing you want to do is get it from the front
  - If there's a run on the bank you sure didn't cause it

  - You can get it from the bottom, you can get it from the top

  - Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
  - And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
  - And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
  - Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die
  - I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
  - And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
  - Then I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
  - And I followed you, Big River, when you called
  - Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
  - A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
  - I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block
  - She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
  - Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
  - Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
  - Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
  - She loves you, Big River, more than me
  - Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
  - And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
  - And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
  - Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

  - Looking out my windows, old lonesome town
  - Thinking of ___ baby, while rain falling down
  - Yeah, heavy on mind baby, all through the night
  - We stay together, we have turned down fine
  - Then I get to thinking now, everywhere I've been
  - I look up and blues does got me again
  - Skies getting dark again and the wind is blowing cold
  - It's about to rain down on my soul
  - Don't your house feel lonesome, when you're all alone
  - Nobody there to hold you in their arms
  - Blues don't care where you're going, never care where you've been
  - Looks like blues done got me again
  - It's cold on the street where we used to stay
  - Now strangers live in that sad house a day
  - I didn't know nobody when I first came to town
  - Faster than _______ reputation down
  - Thinking about a wasted life women wine and gin
  - Looks like blues done got me again
  - A feeling in my bones, and an aching deep inside
  - Working hard to _____ set things right
  - There's a better day coming in if I can hang on long enough
  - Way I used to live I tell you was mighty rough
  - Blues don't care where you're going, never care where you've been
  - Looks like blues done got me again
  - It hurts to know I hurt you all the ways I let you done
  - I'm here to say I'm sorry and a new way I have found
  - The sun is shining down, clouds are in the west
  - The way it keeps on blowing, I can't find my rest
  - Blues don't care where you're going, never care where you've been
  - Looks like blues done got me again

  - In the mirror I can see someone that used to, used to be me
  - And I turn blue in the cold grey light of dawn

  - I lean hard, hard on the bottle 'til I no longer can stand up right
  - In the morning in my room I'm like a body in a tomb
  - Those same three walls keep coming on kind of strong
  - Down the highway then I drive I'm more dead than alive
  - And I turn blue in the cold grey light of dawn
  - Neon lights and the jukebox help to ease me through the night
  - I lean hard, hard on the bottle 'til I no longer can stand up right

  - In the north east of Brazil, there's a music that they play
  - "They call this music Forr\xF3, I'm going down there today"
  - They can jump it in the street, they can rock the big dance hall
  - "They call this music Forr\xF3, 'cause Forr\xF3 means for all"
  - Music can bring us together, it can heal all your wounds
  - You feel it in your heart, you can put it in the soup
  - There's a world in trouble, it's all in the news
  - "But people are coming together, playing Forr\xF3 and the blues"
  - "Forr\xF3's played with heart, about every day and place"
  - For people of every color and all their daily cares
  - Christo Redentor's stayin' on Corcovado's heel
  - He beckons you to come on down to Brazil
  - Come on, down don't be so serious, come on, let's have some fun
  - "Blues has met the Forr\xF3, something new has begun"
  - Put a smile on your face, no time to be a pout
  - Break all the rules and join us down tonight

  - A wise man was telling stories to me
  - About the places he had been to and the things that had seen
  - A quiet voice is singing something to me
  - An age old song 'bout the home of the brave in this land here of the free
  - One time one night in America
  - A lady dressed in white with the man she loves
  - Standing along the side of their pickup truck
  - A shot rang out in the night
  - When everything seemed right
  - Another headline written down in America
  - The guy that lived next door in three-o-five
  - Took the kids to the park and disappeared 'bout half past nine
  - Who will ever know how much she loved them so
  - That dark night alone in America
  - A quiet voice is singing something to me
  - An age old song 'bout the home of the brave in this land here of the free
  - One time one night in America
  - Four small boys playing ball in the parking lot
  - A preacher, a teacher, and the other became a cop
  - A car skidded in the rain
  - Making the last little one a saint
  - One more light goes out in America
  - A young girl tosses a coin in the wishing well
  - She hopes for a heaven while for her there's just this hell
  - She gave away her life to become somebody's wife
  - Another wish unanswered in America
  - People having so much faith
  - Die too soon while all the rest come late
  - We write a song that no one sings
  - On a cold black stone where a lasting peace will finally bring
  - Sunlight plays upon my window pane
  - I wake up to a world that's just the same
  - My father said to be strong
  - That a good man could never do wrong
  - In a dream I had last night in America
  - A wise man was telling stories to me
  - About the places he had been to and the things that had seen
  - A quiet voice is singing something to me
  - An age old song 'bout the home of the brave in this land here of the free

  - I looked for my friends but I never could find them
  - I found they were all rank strangers to me
  - Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
  - No mother or dad, not a friend could I see
  - They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
  - I found they were all rank strangers to me
  - '"They''ve all moved away", said the voice of a stranger'
  - To a beautiful home by the bright, crystal sea
  - Some beautiful day, I'll meet 'em in heaven
  - Where no one will be a stranger to me
  - Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
  - No mother or dad, not a friend could I see

  - Mama, your child is cryin'. It's a sad and beautiful world.
  - Mama, your child is cryin'. It's a sad and beautiful world.
  - River towns are tough towns, and Memphis sure is one.
  - It's no wonder how far I've wandered from my home.
  - You can hear it in my voice, and you can see it in my eyes.
  - Going back to that lonely place and rest my soul a while.
  - Mama, your child is cryin'. It's a sad and beautiful world.
  - Mama, your child is cryin'. Such a sad and beautiful world.
  - (Blues harp solo)
  - The highway was callin'; I followed a long, long road.
  - Driftin' from town to town, wherever my faith did roll.
  - I don't care where I'm headed, you know it's just one of those things
  - Rolling along can't you hear? Can't you hear my highway sing?
  - Highway, now highway, won't you sing me back home?
  - Back to that haunted place by the river all alone.
  - Then let the Blues heal what's been torn apart.
  - I can rest my soul and let the river heal my heart, oh
  - Mama, your child is cryin'. It's a sad and beautiful world.
  - Mama, your child is cryin'. It's a sad and beautiful world.
  - So sad.
  - Uh huh.
  - And lonely
  - But that's all right
  - I'm gonna keep on movin'
  - Well, ha, aha, listen to me.

  - Some people ask me, what does a stranger, stranger do?
  - Well, some people ask me, what does a stranger, stranger do?
  - Well, a stranger wears ragged clothes
  - And stuffs newspaper in his shoes
  - Well, I'm a stranger, I'm a long way from home
  - Yes, I'm a stranger, baby and I'm a long way from home
  - Well, because I'm a stranger
  - People wanna try to do me wrong, do me wrong
  - What you gonna do, baby, when your troubles get like mine?
  - Well, what you gonna do, baby, when your troubles get like mine?
  - Well, I know you wanna go spend all my money
  - Shake and stitch up all the chance
  - Yes, I'm just a stranger and I'm just shifting through your channel
  - Well, I'm just a stranger, baby and I'm just passing through your channel
  - Well, now you know, just because I'm a stranger, baby
  - And all your fears want to dog me around

  - Somethin' pounding at the door
  - There's something wrong, ain't nothin' right
  - There's no sign of hope in sight
  - In this neighborhood tonight
  - Now the train comes 'round about 4:09

  - And your soul can catch a feeling rising up from mother earth
  - Well you'll never be the same, and you'll never be alone

  - I was in the burial party
  - That went back to Wounded Knee
  - With rock hammers and ice picks
  - To chip the dead ones free
  - After the massacre and the blizzard
  - They'd been frozen to the ground
  - Mother's and children and warriors
  - We found them all around
  - They were frozen in their agony
  - Or shock and terror as they fled
  - The army's giant howitzers
  - That sang their song of death
  - We found Chief Big Foot
  - His scarf around his face
  - The ice was frozen blood
  - From his neck down to his waist
  - The bloody footprints along the creek
  - Did the ghost dance for the dead
  - And I hoped that it was true
  - What all the legends said
  - That there'll be a new spring coming
  - And our families will come home
  - And game will fill the prairies
  - And the crops will always grow
  - We wrapped the bodies in red blankets
  - And placed them on our sled
  - And left their stacked up rifles
  - And the few things that they had
  - '"Crazy Horse is buried here"'
  - Someone said as we were due to start
  - '"Just his heart" I told him, crying'
  - '"It''s only just his heart"'

  - It was late in the summer when the corn was fully grown
  - We'd gone for a swim in the pond on my uncle Henry's farm
  - And when we got home we saw a badger in the yard
  - Running flat out for a hole beneath the shed
  - It disappeared into its den underneath the floor
  - And it was gone and Dad just said "Goddamn
  - Badger can't stay he'll kill you just like that
  - Mean as any grizzly, sneaky as any cat"
  - And he went and got his gun from the closet in the hall
  - And pulled a 6-pack from the fridge and walked on out the door
  - While Mom made us brush our teeth and get ourselves to bed
  - '"It''s late and he''ll be awhile" was all that she would say'
  - And I saw him in the twilight his .410 across his lap
  - Sitting in a lawn chair, staring at the shed
  - A fallen soldier from the 6-pack laying at his feet
  - And sometime in the night a gunshot woke me from my sleep
  - It was late in the summer when the corn was fully grown
  - We'd gone for a swim in the pond on my uncle Henry's farm

  - If you were 5 years old again
  - Would you turn your face to the air
  - To see the cropduster flying up there
  - Would you turn your face to the air
  - Would you stand in the wash of the wind
  - With your mouth open wide as your arms
  - Would you fall the ground and roll in the grass
  - Would you stand in the wash of the wind
  - I'm 5 years old
  - 5 years old again
  - Would you wade in the water in the ditch
  - Or jump in the puddle in the drive
  - And to hell with your shoes and the cuffs of your pants
  - Would you wade in the water in the ditch
  - Would you hide underneath the sheets
  - And tune out your fear of the dark
  - And that tapping on the glass in the middle of the night
  - Would you hide underneath the sheets
  - I'm 5 years old
  - 5 years old again
  - Run to hear the roar of the plane
  - See the leaves of the beans bending down
  - Feel the spray hit you in the face
  - And wait for it to come again
  - Today I was 5 years old
  - And I turned my face to the air
  - But the airplane's roar turned to ash in my ear
  - And I'll never grow young again

  - I ain't been but one little place and lived here all my life
  - I ain't known but one woman and now she is my wife
  - Never been further than up the road to the town and back again
  - Never known but a handful of folks and them I call my friends
  - Now I'm going to leave here
  - Now I'm going away
  - Keep my fiddle tuned for me
  - I'll need it some sweet day
  - Well the preacher said to my only son I'll sign you up for war
  - You'll fight for your life far from your home and never come back no more
  - Well my only son come home one day and we buried him up the hill
  - Next to his auntie and old grandma and dear old uncle bill
  - Now I'm going to leave here
  - Now I'm going away
  - Keep my fiddle tuned for me
  - I'll need it some sweet day
  - Now I'm gonna go myself and see what's it's all about
  - Why'd they take a poor man's son he was all I got
  - Who's pockets are filled with gold and they don't have to fight
  - Or leave home and say goodbye to their kids and worry on them all night
  - Now I'm going to leave here
  - Now I'm going away
  - Keep my fiddle tuned for me
  - I'll need it some sweet day
  - I set up camp one day on the street where the rich man lived
  - He won't come out and talk to me he don't have the time to give
  - But'll call the cops and say roustabout's a-living on our place
  - So take him away and all his kind I don't wanna see his face
  - Now I'm going to leave here
  - Now I'm going away
  - Keep my fiddle tuned for me
  - I'll need it some sweet day
  - I wished I'd stayed to home and kept my son there too
  - You can give to the rich man all day long but he'll never give back to you
  - So they can call me roustabout and do it all they please
  - Never will I stop for them or get down on my knees
  - Now I'm going to leave here
  - Now I'm going away
  - Keep my fiddle tuned for me
  - I'll need it some sweet day

  - Death row inmate, believs that she is god
  - Voices that she hears, would never steers her wrong
  - No medication to dull that circus in her mind
  - No medication to help her understand her crime
  - Well death row inmate, round about noon
  - Tried to kill the guard with a plastic spoon
  - They placed her in cuffs in a padded room
  - They took away her books and gave her some paper shoes
  - They put her in the infirmirary
  - Kept the door shut
  - Sprayed her with a hose
  - She began to shout
  - Doctor came with a nurse
  - And tied her to a chair
  - '''Cause she thought she was dying'
  - And pulled out all her hair
  - And the day rose morning
  - She's loaded with all those meds
  - Sitting with the inmates
  - Droolin all over their jellybread
  - Brick sound sad tunes on a piano near the wall
  - Till the nurse takes off the cuffs
  - So Ellen can reach all the keys
  - Knocked her in the wall
  - And went yellin' in the yard
  - Well Ellen kills two inmates
  - And the Nurse up in the ward
  - No one wonders much about the voices in their head
  - No one wonders if they still spoke after they had killed her dead
  - Death row inmate, believs that she is god
  - Voices that she hears, would never steers her wrong
  - No medication to dull that circus in her mind
  - No medication can help her understand her crime

  - Eldon caught outta Portland with Fargo on his mind
  - Found an empty icebox and stuffed himself inside
  - They made good time to Billings but he hadn't eaten in 3 days
  - They made good time to Billings but he hadn't eaten in 3 days
  - Daren't poke his head out they shook for tramps all along the way
  - His reefer was cut out in Dilworth but he still kept outta sight

  - He just couldn't stop shaking but he stayed in the hole all night
  - When he finally climbed out of that icebox he was too weak too stand

  - He collapsed down to the gravel and prayed, "Lord give me your hand"
  - But the good Lord didn't hear him and the police found him first
  - But the good Lord didn't hear him and the police found him first
  - The chief stared hard to his face and Eldon heard him curse
  - You're the dirty rounder that shot his girl out west
  - You're the dirty rounder that shot his girl out west

  - I had to leave the farm when I was 15
  - Too many mouths for what we had
  - And I bummed my way to the coast
  - But things out there were just as bad
  - The wind blows the topsoil to the sea
  - What's left is barren and grey
  - I came home to make my stand behind the plow
  - And odd jobs when the times got tight
  - But the work faces me every morning
  - And the worry haunts me all the night
  - The wind blows the topsoil to the sea
  - What's left is barren and grey
  - I can't bear to see kids starving on TV
  - Poor folks can't afford enough to eat
  - Grain rots in storage for the price
  - The market has no worries for what's right
  - The wind blows the topsoil to the sea
  - What's left is barren and grey
  - When I'm dead the kids'll dump my ashes
  - Into the oil of our Allis '53
  - And I'll live just as long as that tractor
  - And die when the rust carries me to the sea
  - The wind blows the topsoil to the sea
  - What's left is barren and grey
  - These crops have gone from green to brown
  - And my hair's gone from brown to grey
  - And the sun will surely shine upon these fields
  - And I will kneel to pray for rain today
  - The wind blows the topsoil to the sea
  - What's left is barren and grey

  - Now who would have thought
  - That a mother's own son
  - Would sleep 'neath the bridge
  - Bothered by none
  - And who would have known
  - How he'd fought in the war
  - And seen all the horrors
  - That war is known for
  - I'd never suppose
  - That his Mom would approve
  - Of garbage can dinners
  - And boots lined with the news
  - And he grew to a man
  - But a little too fast
  - And before anyone knew
  - The world altered his path
  - How could she protect him
  - What could she do
  - For her own little son
  - When the world pushed it's way through
  - She couldn't bear to see it
  - Her heart it did break
  - She couldn't help her boy
  - And she just passed away
  - Now he's alone
  - More alone than before
  - With no roof to shield him
  - And rocks for his floor
  - And he hears her soft voice
  - Beckoning him home
  - Where he'll always be loved
  - And never alone
  - Who would have known it
  - Known of her life
  - To find him like this
  - In the cold morning light

  - Year of nineteen hundred and twelve, April the fourteenth day
  - Great Titanic struck an iceberg, people had to run and pray
  - God moves, moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray

  - When they heard the great excitement, then a gunshot was fired
  - God moves, moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
  - Captain Smith gave orders, women and children first
  - Many of the lifeboats piled right up, many were liable to crush
  - God moves on, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
  - So many had to leave their happy home, all that they possess
  - Lord Jesus, will you hear us now, help us in our distress
  - God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, people had to run and pray
  - Women had to leave their loving ones, see 'bout their safety
  - When they heard the liner was doomed, hearts did almost break
  - God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
  - A.G. Smith, mighty man, built a boat that he couldn't understand
  - Named it a name of God in a tin, without a "c", Lord, he pulled it in
  - God moves, ah, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
  - '(Spoken: Well) Ah, ah, Lord'

  - I had a girlfriend once but she's no longer there

  - Just like Ramblin' Robin
  - And the tramps who went before
  - Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
  - Baptized out on the road
  - Anywhere but here

  - Just outside of my hometown
  - With a backpack and a bedroll
  - And swore I'd never hop back down
  - Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
  - Baptized out on the road
  - Anywhere but here
  - When I made to jump off the train
  - My legs were numb and stiff
  - They buckled when I hit the ground
  - And I lit down in a ditch
  - Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
  - Baptized out on the road
  - Anywhere but here
  - I hung out with some rough folks
  - We went in on a scam
  - But the blame was mine when the cops came
  - And the jailhouse my new home
  - Anywhere but here, anywhere but here
  - Baptized out on the road
  - Anywhere but here

  - Baptized out on the road
  - Anywhere but here
  - This ain't the life I want
  - I'm telling you the truth
  - Gonna get my things together

  - Well uncle Jack was a gambler
  - Every night he lost all he had
  - Every night he lost all he had
  - Talkin' bout 3am he'd gotten it all back
  - He talked through the side of his mouth
  - He chompin on some big cigar, chompin on some big cigar
  - He used to tell me stories about the war
  - And if I had to do it over, all over again
  - You know I'd want to be just like him
  - Well uncle Jack met a movie star
  - And I bragged it up all over town
  - Bragged it up all over town
  - Well the funny thing is she was never 'round
  - I saw the TV selling cars, straight on the back
  - Sellin cars, straight on the back
  - She said she'd bring a nice Lincoln for uncle Jack
  - And if I had to do it over, all over again
  - You know I'd want to be just like him
  - Well uncle Jack was a natural
  - Gambling everything all his life
  - Gambling everything all his life
  - He was 49 on the day he lost his wife
  - Well he lost her at a card game
  - Bluffed and he only had a pair
  - Bluffed and he only had a pair
  - Talkin' bout 3am, went home and left her there
  - And if I had to do it over, all over again
  - You know I'd want to be just like him

  - There was an old man name of Rudy Moen
  - 80 acres was all he owned
  - Old Rudy's clothes didn't fit him right
  - Fit for a man 'bout twice his size
  - He could wear 'em when he was young
  - Back then farmin' was all he done
  - Had no wife and he had no kids
  - Raising corn was all he did
  - Now he sits and smokes his pipe
  - Has a sip of whisky every night
  - Here comes the county 'cause they want his land
  - It done gone fallow and that won't stand
  - Rudy won't go and he just can't stay
  - That county judge gonna put him away
  - Social worker came by but Rudy ain't home
  - '''We can''t just leave him out here all alone'''
  - They found old Rudy down in the shed
  - Hanging on a rope tied round his neck
  - Note in his pocket this is what it said

  - There's someone out there, Out in the snow
  - I think that I knew her, long time ago
  - Homemade outfit, frayed cap and gloves
  - She is a monument, a tribute cause.
  - It must be a bus stop, there through the snow
  - The wind whips right through her thin winter coat
  - (Mm-hmm)
  - She pulls a cart behind her, there are tracks in the snow
  - That lead to her possessions, tied up just so.
  - I know that I knew her, but I can't say how.
  - Long time before anyway, the way she is now.
  - There's someone out there, but I can't make her out
  - Salvation Army shoes on, sole all walked out.
  - I know that I knew her, we were in love.
  - Long time gone anyhow, there comes the bus
  - Crowd pushes past her, no one looks twice
  - She looks through her window, and I catch her eye
  - She doesn't know me, She looks away.
  - The bus slowly disappears through the snowy haze.

  - Here's a little thing about Mag and Stan hauling down the road in the winter time
  - Riding on their thumbs but walking most of the way
  - Stan used to hop trains but Mag's afraid so they get their traveling done another
    way
  - Just wanna get down south to where it's warm
  - True friends, true friends are hard to find
  - To get one you gotta be one
  - And then they'll always be around
  - An old guy stops in a beat-up ford and asks how far did they wanna go
  - And Stan says we're going all the way to the end
  - This old guy he's lost his wife and lost his grip on the rest of his life
  - Just drives around now listening to the radio
  - True friends, true friends are hard to find
  - To get one you gotta be one
  - And then they'll always be around
  - Now it's 4 days on the road in that rusty ride and 3 nights sleeping out on the
    side
  - Eating roadstand fruit, coffee and refried beans
  - When they reach the gulf they all lay on the beach and soak up the sun and get
    used to the heat
  - Talkin' about how cold it is up in I. Falls
  - True friends, true friends are hard to find
  - To get one you gotta be one
  - And then they'll always be around
  - There ain't no end to their family, their web covers the whole country
  - Maybe it ain't true that we have to be alone
  - Maybe they'll just drive around pickin' folks up, being your friend when your
    down on your luck
  - Maybe there's a car big enough for us all
  - True friends, true friends are hard to find
  - To get one you gotta be one

  - Beside him strolled a little girl both beautiful and sweet

  - On the father and his little angel child
  - From over the way there came a lady
  - Burning tears seemed to blind her eyes
  - '"Oh, look, Papa, there goes Mama," cried the little innocent'
  - But the father quickly drew his babe away
  - She has fallen by the wayside
  - She has gone beyond recall
  - Not a hand would stretch to save her
  - Not a friend that she could call
  - Every door has closed against her
  - Not a (friend/soul) for her will mourn
  - She has fallen by the wayside
  - She has gone beyond recall
  - In a cozy little cottage sitting close behind the trees
  - All around the porch grew ivy
  - And a pathway strewn with leaves
  - In a cozy little parlor sitting close beside the fire
  - Was a happy little family at home
  - Pressed close beside the cottage window
  - A sad face was looking in
  - '"Take me back," the poor one whispered, it came'

  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled all around, in and out the town
  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled till the butchers cut him down
  - He rambled in a gambling game, he gambled on the green
  - The gamblers there showed him a trick that he had never seen
  - He lost his roll and jewelry, he like to lost his life
  - He lost the car that carried him there and somebody stole his wife
  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled all around, in and out the town
  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled till the butchers cut him down
  - He rambled in a swell hotel, his appetite was stout
  - And when he refused to pay the bill, the landlord kicked him out
  - He reached a brick to smack him with and when he went to stop
  - The landlord kicked him over the fence right in a barrel of slop
  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled all around, in and out the town
  - And didn't he ramble, ramble
  - He rambled till the butchers cut him down

  - She promised to meet me
  - When the clock struck twenty-three
  - Down at the stockyard about a mile and a half away
  - Where pickle pig's feet and hog's ears
  - Sell for nineteen cents a pound
  - She's my freckle-faced consumption Sara Jane
  - Oh she's my daisy, she's blackeyed and crazy
  - The sweetest girl I thought I ever saw
  - Now her breath smells sweet, but I'd rather smell her feet
  - For she's my freckle-faced consumption Sara Jane
  - I'm the man that rode the mule around the world
  - I'm the man that rode the mule around the world
  - I rode in Noah's ark and I'm as happy as a lark
  - I'm the man that rode the mule around the world
  - I was born four thousand years ago
  - And there's nothing on this earth I do not know
  - I saw Moses on the water fighting Pharaoh and his armies
  - And I can whip the man that says it isn't so
  - I saw Satan when he searched the garden o'er
  - I saw Satan when he searched the garden o'er
  - The apple Eve were eating, through the bushes I was peeping
  - I can prove that I'm the man that ate the core
  - I'm a highly educated man
  - And there's things in my brain that I have planned
  - Now I've been on earth so long till I've learned to sing a song
  - That old Abraham and Jacob used to sing
  - I rode in Noah's ark, he surround me with a shark
  - I rode up to the line and I fell off against a pine

  - Talk about your whiskey and your bygone days
  - Be not offend. I've got it to spend
  - You'll find gold enough along to pave the new Jerusalem

  - I loved her well but it's sad to tell, she'd chew her chewing gum
  - There was no laws to stop her jaws which worked like a machine
  - What could I do? So I let her chew, when she was sweet sixteen
  - She chewed all day, chewed all night, that was going some
  - She hardly stopped to chew her meals, she was so fond of gum
  - She chewed and chawed, chawed and chewed, and her brand was wintergreen
  - And while I wooed, this girl she chewed, when she was sweet sixteen
  - She had a way so cute and gay of sticking gum around
  - Down on the chairs or on the stairs those wads of gum was found
  - I often cussed because they mussed my passing plod unseen
  - I had great luck in getting stuck on this day was sweet sixteen
  - Some days have passed since I stuck fast to that sweetheart of mine
  - And now and then you'll find again a wad of gum divine
  - I had a mat on which I sat and called her my colleen
  - It's stuck to me and so has she since the day she was sixteen

  - While a tear stood in his eye

  - Or a sister, or a brother?
  - He waited all these many years in vain
  - Oh, from early morning light
  - He would wait 'til dark at night
  - For the letter but, alas, it never came
  - As he waited all these years
  - Joy mingled with his tears

  - Might as well get used to you hanging around
  - Good morning heartache, sit down
  - Stop haunting me now
  - Can't chase you no how
  - Just leave me alone
  - I've got those Monday blues
  - Straight through Sunday blues
  - Good morning heartache, here we go again
  - Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when

  - I'm in the mood for love
  - Simply because you're near me.
  - Funny, but when you're near me
  - I'm in the mood for love.
  - Heaven is in your eyes
  - Bright as the stars we're under
  - Oh! Is it any wonder
  - I'm in the mood for love?
  - 'Why stop to think of whether '
  - This little dream might fade?
  - 'We''ve put our hearts together '
  - Now we are one, I'm not afraid!
  - If there's a cloud above
  - If it should rain we'll let it
  - But for tonight, forget it!
  - I'm in the mood for love

  - In A Sentimental Mood
  - I can see the stars come through my room
  - While your loving attitude
  - Is like a flame that lights the gloom
  - On the wings of ev'ry kiss
  - Drift a melody so strange and sweet
  - In this sentimental bliss you make my
  - Paradise complete
  - Rose pearls seem to fall
  - It's all like a dream to call you mine
  - My heart's lighter thing
  - Since you made me this night a thing divine
  - In A Sentimental Mood
  - I'm within a world so heavenly
  - For I never dreamt
  - That you'd be loving sentimental me
  - In A Sentimental Mood

  - Do you love me
  - Just like I love you
  - Are you my life to be

  - Long the skies were overcast
  - But now the clouds have passed
  - You're here at last

  - Just one look and then I knew
  - That all I longed for long ago was you

  - Out yonder where the blue begins
  - The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
  - Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
  - Over the rim of the hill?
  - 'Can''t we sail away on a little dream '
  - And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
  - Let's build a stairway to the stars
  - A lovely stairway to the stars

  - If your mem'ry serves you well,

  - So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
  - And sit before it gets too late.
  - No man alive will come to you

  - But you know that we shall meet again
  - If your mem'ry serves you well.
  - This wheel's on fire,
  - Rolling down the road,
  - Best notify my next of kin,
  - This wheel shall explode!
  - If your mem'ry serves you well,
  - I was goin' to confiscate your lace,
  - And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
  - And hide it in your case.
  - If I knew for sure that it was yours
  - But it was oh so hard to tell.
  - But you knew that we would meet again,
  - If your mem'ry serves you well.
  - This wheel's on fire,
  - Rolling down the road,
  - Best notify my next of kin,
  - This wheel shall explode!
  - If your mem'ry serves you well,
  - You'll remember you're the one
  - That called on me to call on them
  - To get you your favors done.
  - And after ev'ry plan had failed
  - And there was nothing more to tell,
  - You knew that we would meet again,
  - If your mem'ry served you well.
  - This wheel's on fire,
  - Rolling down the road,
  - Best notify my next of kin,

  - For it's time for the ballot for women you see!
  - The mother is asking for power to be shared
  - Politicians are angry and criminals scared
  - But the father (wise man!) says, "Jest e'en let it be
  - The home will be safer when women are free"
  - There are bad men against it but good on our side
  - Tradition is narrow but progress is wide
  - There are brave, honest brothers three thousand times three
  - Who will give us the ballot and let us go free
  - There is love in her heart, there is light in her eye
  - Her conscience is clear and her courage is high
  - There is hope for the world when the women are free
  - Just give us the ballot and then you will see!

  - In the cause of nobler motherhood

  - Money don't matter as long as I scatter a little bit of happiness around
  - If people keep a grinnin' I figure I'm a winnin' my good old yakety sound
  - City folks go around turnin' up their noses and countin' their greenbacks and
    smellin' their roses
  - But I wouldn't trade my yakety axe, even for a T-bone
  - I'm confessin' I never took a lesson, all my notes are a matter of guessin'
  - Hopin' they'll come out in some kinda manner that'll make the yakety sound
  - So if you're in the mood and your feet start tappin'
  - And you feel laid back and your hands start clappin'
  - Then I'll have done what I wanted to from way back
  - You're diggin' my yakety axe

  - You make time and you make love dandy
  - You make swell molasses candy
  - But honey are you makin' any money?
  - That's all I want to know
  - You make fun and you could make trouble
  - Make mistakes and that goes double
  - But honey are you makin' any money?
  - That's all I want to know
  - You make dates, and you make trains
  - I can get that through my head
  - It's a cinch, in a pinch you could make breakfast
  - Even make the bed
  - You make good when you make a promise
  - No I'm not a doubting Thomas
  - But honey are you makin' any money?
  - That's all I want to know
  - You've got to hand it to the fair sex
  - They're anything but slow
  - They're revolutionizing romance
  - Each Romeo should know
  - They don't want to hear about the moonlight
  - Or the flowers, or the spring
  - Here's a little question they will ask you
  - When you flash that famous ring

  - Folks, I want to tell you what a hard luck man I am
  - I was born in hard luck
  - I was born on the last month in the year
  - The last week in the month
  - The last day in the week
  - The last hour in the day
  - The last minute in the hour
  - And the last second in the minute
  - And to tell the truth about it, I liked not to got here at all
  - I had a job one time a-working in a grocery store
  - A lady came in and I asked what I could do for her
  - 'And she says: "What is your butter today?"'
  - 'I said: "Lady, my butter is butter today"'
  - 'She said: "Well, I''m glad it is'
  - That I got here yesterday was axle grease"
  - So the boss fired me. Oh, I'm hard luck
  - So I went on down the street and I got me another job
  - In a ladies' shoe store
  - That was a good job too
  - All I had to do when a lady came in to try on a pair of shoes
  - Was just to lace up her laces
  - But the boss fired me there. He said I got above my job
  - So I went on down the street and I got another job in a department store
  - One day a lady came in, and I asked her what could I do for her
  - 'She said: "I''d like to see your underwear, young man"'
  - 'I told her: "You''ll have to excuse me this time'
  - I don't wear any. It's too hot"
  - The boss fired me there too. Oh, I'm hard luck. Ain't no doubt of that
  - Then I got another job, in a dry-goods store
  - One day a lady came in and wanted to buy a pair of hose
  - I asked her what size she wore
  - She said she forgot her number
  - And I told her I was sorry but we didn't have any dressing room to try 'em on
    in
  - So the boss came back there wantin' to know what the trouble was
  - 'And I told the boss about it. He said: "Well now, I''ll tell you what to do:'
  - All you young men clerks go back to the back end of the store
  - And let the lady go behind the counter and try her on a pair of hose
  - And the first one I catch of you looking, I gonna fire him right then"
  - Well, after I lost that job, I started to singing for a living
  - And now I'm gonna sing you all a little song entitled
  - '"In Time of Trouble, Prepare for Walkin''"'
  - My bonnie bent over his gas tank
  - The height of its contents to see
  - He lighted a match to assist him
  - Oh, bring back my bonnie to me
  - Bring back, bring back
  - Oh, bring back my bonnie to me

  - And ooze right over in the Promised Land
  - Go easy. Make it easy. Go greasy
  - Standin' in the corner by the mantelpiece
  - Up in the corner by a bucket of grease

  - Went slippin' up and down that mantelpiece

  - Make up the beds, gal, make 'em up nice
  - Clean out the house, and chase out the mice
  - Set up the table, and set it up right
  - '''Cause old Preacher Johnson''s gonna be here tonight'
  - He's a chicken eater. Loves cakes. Loves the sisters, too
  - Standin' on the corner, standin' like a man

  - Standin' on the corner with a bucket in my hand

  - I pulled that trigger and the gun said "blip"
  - Jumped on that hog with all my grip
  - Earin' hog eye. Love chittlins
  - Behind the henhouse the other night
  - It was awful dark and I had no light
  - The farmer's dog run out by chance
  - And he bit a big hole in the seat of my pants
  - I jumped gullies. Robe bushes. Plowed ground. Felt funny
  - Behind the henhouse on my knees
  - I thought I heard a chicken sneeze
  - Only a rooster sayin' his prayers
  - And givin' out hymns to the hens upstairs
  - Just preachin'. Hens a-singin'. Little young chickens just a-hopin'
  - They put me in the jailhouse on my knees
  - All they give me was a pan of peas
  - The peas was red and the meat was fat
  - And I got stuck on the jailhouse just for that
  - Go sassy. Impudent. Wanted to fight
  - Now I been here and I been there
  - I rambled round 'most everywhere
  - Purtiest little gal I ever did see
  - A-walkin' up and down by the side of me
  - Mouth wide open. Catchin' flies. Knows I'm crazy
  - There ain't no use of me workin' so hard
  - I got a woman in the white folk's yard
  - When she kill a chicken she saves me the head
  - She thinks I'm workin' but I'm lyin' in the bed
  - Sleepin'. Havin' a good time. Dreamin' about her
  - There ain't no use of me workin' so hard
  - I got a woman in the white folk's yard
  - When she kill a chicken she saves me the feet
  - She thinks I'm workin' but I'm loafin' the street
  - Havin' a good time. Talkin' about her. To two other women

  - The wife you did take
  - It was all a mistake
  - And you're married
  - And Jesus it's hell
  - You thought she was smarter
  - So you loved her hard
  - And then you said
  - '"But how could I tell?"'
  - You did not love her but many times over
  - You used her and pushed her aside
  - And when she came to you
  - You screamed what can I do I do not want you for a bride"
  - You told her don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - And then as she cried in your nonchalant stride
  - You just laughed and told her to grow up
  - It was not important she'd have an abortion
  - Was $500 enough?
  - But somehow the family that you hadn't thought of
  - Did not feel like ending a life
  - The wedding was planned and you wept like a man
  - As she grew up and became your wife
  - And you told her don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - You used her some more and then finally she bore
  - An awakening moment of truth
  - Reality kills and these mountains of bills
  - Do you have a gun I could use
  - The wife you had taken now thin and misshapen
  - Was ugly from having your child
  - The ugliness spread
  - And at last separate beds
  - She was lucky if you'd even smile
  - You told her don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - The worn out excuse for your constant abuse
  - Was the one thing you had on your side
  - Your wife had been made and so many times laid
  - And a recommendation was tried
  - Your best friend of all told you she's a good ball
  - And the thing that had made it much worse
  - The son that you had that would soon call you dad
  - Well you really weren't sure it was yours
  - And you told her don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - The times you had tried you could not satisfy
  - And your efforts you knew were in vain
  - The fact that before she'd had many good scores
  - Was a pounding down hard on your brain
  - And so finally of course you asked for a divorce
  - But you could not get her to say yes
  - So you stormed out the door in your search for a whore
  - Who could make you forget the whole mess
  - And you said now don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - So she came to me and said help me oh please
  - I think that you know why I'm here
  - And so it was done and while you had your fun
  - I made love through an ocean of tears
  - Yeah she was with me but it ain't hard to see
  - When a woman is thinking of love.
  - I saw in her face during every embrace
  - It was you that she was thinking of
  - And you told her don't talk to strangers
  - And don't even smile
  - '''Cause it''s all your damn fault that we''ve got this sick child'
  - You know I don't love you and I never did
  - Now we're stuck living here with a kid that just coughs in his room
  - My mother was right what she said about you
  - Now I've been a thinking for hours and hours
  - My reason for wonderin in vain
  - The one thing I want in this whole big old world
  - Is the girl that your'e driving insane
  - Well you want your freedom and I want her lovin'
  - But I know it never can be
  - The thing that you tell me has ruined your life
  - Well god knows I wish it'd happened to me!
  - Yeah and she don't talk to strangers
  - She never did smile
  - And it wasn't her fault that you both had that child
  - She really did love you I know that she did
  - And she loved livin' there taking care of that kid and his cough
  - If you'd have married your mother you'd have been better off

  - Just another day without you
  - I'll be okay without you
  - I'll be fine
  - I'll be all right
  - I'll find someone new without you
  - Somebody just like you but not you
  - I'll be all right
  - Say, I'll be all right
  - But I'm breaking apart inside
  - I'm breaking apart inside
  - I cry in my sleep at night
  - I'm breaking apart without you
  - I hardly ever think about you
  - You said I'd call, but I don't need to
  - I'll be fine
  - I got so much to do without you
  - You said that I'd be lost without you
  - I'll be fine
  - Just give me time
  - '''Cause I''m breaking apart inside'
  - I'm breaking apart inside
  - I cry in my sleep at night
  - I'm breaking apart without you
  - And I'm hoping you're doing fine, too
  - I don't want to sleep without you
  - Dreams don't mean a thing without you
  - I feel so alone without you
  - Baby, come back, I need you
  - I'm breaking apart inside
  - I'm breaking apart inside
  - I cry in my sleep at night
  - I'm breaking apart without you
  - Now I'm wonderin' if you're doing fine, too

  - I saw a star above the clouds
  - It was the brightest one
  - And I have just begun
  - To understand you
  - You give me reason to believe
  - And though I've doubted you
  - You always see me through
  - I would owe to you
  - Your love
  - You give it away
  - I fall to my knees and I pray
  - And from a cross
  - They say you give your love to everyone
  - I think of all I've done
  - And still you care for me
  - Your love
  - You give it away
  - I fall to my knees and I pray
  - Your love
  - And in the crowd I smile and listen
  - As the children sing
  - Their voices caroling
  - Each year, it means one thing
  - 'Your love '
  - 'You give it away '
  - I fall to my knees and I pray
  - 'Your love '
  - 'Your love '
  - 'I praise your love '

  - On the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot
  - Dan dropped in about five o'clock
  - Took off his coat, said "The night is short."
  - He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart
  - He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops are gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried."
  - Dan got happy and he started raving
  - He jerked out a razor, but he wasn't shaving
  - And all the cats knew to jump and hop
  - He was born and raised in a butcher shop
  - He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops is gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried, fried, fried, yeah."
  - The cops heard Dan when he started to shout
  - They all ran in to see what it was about
  - And I heard him holler as they led him away
  - He turned his head and this is what he had to say
  - Hollered, "Rave on children, I'm with ya!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops is gone.'
  - Let's all get Dixie fried, fried, fried." Scotty!
  - Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw
  - And he let us all know he wasn't scared of the law
  - Through the black crossed bars, tossed a note to his dear
  - And it said "It ain't my fault, sugar, that I'm in here."
  - But He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you!
  - Rave on, cats," he cried.
  - '"It''s almost dawn, the cops ain''t gone'
  - And I've been Dixie fried."

  - I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting
  - I have pictures in my troubled past,
  - And they're shaped like broken glass.
  - I have memories I kept of you,
  - I return them with goodbyes.
  - '''Cause I''m not waiting for you anymore,'
  - I don't care what might have been.
  - I'm not waiting for you anymore,
  - I give up my love can't win.
  - But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I'll love you still.
  - But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I always will.
  - I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting
  - I still think about what used to be,
  - I have dreams that might have been.
  - Someone else will walk beside you soon,
  - Now I know my love can't win.
  - So I'm not waiting for you anymore,
  - I don't care what might have been.
  - I'm not waiting for you anymore,
  - I give up so why pretend?
  - But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I'll love you still.
  - But in my heart, my heart, I know that though I go I always will.
  - I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting

  - I believe the stars keep shining all through the night
  - I believe if we just keep trying it will be all right
  - I believe that someday we're gonna find our way

  - Yeah I believe it's gonna work out okay
  - But not for me, and not for you
  - I believe, I believe, I believe
  - I believe, I believe, I believe
  - I believe there's an answer waiting when the day is done
  - I believe if you just keep searching you'll find someone
  - I believe that you and I just lost our way
  - And I believe in a beautiful day
  - I still believe in a beautiful day
  - But not for me, and not for you
  - I know you tried, and I tried to
  - Sometime all our dreams just don't come true

  - I like the way you don't have to fake it
  - Knew right from the start it would be fine
  - Later
  - I was laying in bed trying to catch my breath
  - Half-ashamed, half-smiling at the things we did
  - She made it clear from the start it was a one night stand
  - But I was thinking of ways to make her change her plan
  - Nobody else ever made me feel this way
  - Sounds shallow, well I'm sorry what should I say
  - I like the way you move me

  - There is a woman
  - Trying hard to be brave
  - The way that I hurt her
  - Has made her afraid
  - Things that I'm doing
  - Are breaking her heart
  - Still she's pretending
  - We'll never part
  - Lie to me
  - Lie
  - Lie to me
  - Lie
  - I don't care what people may say
  - I know everybody lies
  - I'm not trying to hurt my love
  - I'm only trying to get by
  - There is a woman
  - Far over the sea
  - Standing and waiting
  - Praying for me
  - Here I lie sleeping
  - A girl by my side
  - Who am I hurting
  - Each time I lie?
  - Lie to me

  - Broken sky, heartaches that flowers won't mend
  - Say goodbye knowing that this is the end
  - Tender dreams, shadows fall
  - Love too sweet to recall
  - Dry your eyes, face the dawn
  - Life will go on
  - Life will go on
  - All along, thought that we still had a chance
  - Letting go, this is the end of romance
  - Broken heart find your way
  - Make it through just this day
  - Face the world on your own
  - Life will go on
  - Life will go on
  - There'll be blue skies, there'll be true love
  - Someday I'll hold you again
  - They'll be blue skies in a better world, darlin'
  - Tender dreams, shadows fall
  - Love too sweet to recall
  - Dry your eyes, Face the dawn
  - Life will go on

  - I met a girl she was half out of her mind.
  - That's okay 'cause I'm half out of mine.
  - She said I'm tired of love, all the games, and crying.
  - And all I want from you is a real good time.
  - Said I know how you feel 'cause I've been there too.
  - She said you're wasting time we got things to do.
  - I like the way you move me.
  - I like the way you bring it to me.
  - Love the way you know what's on my mind.
  - I like the way you shake it.
  - I like the way you don't have to fake it.
  - Knew right from the start it would be fine.
  - Later.
  - I was laying in bed trying to catch my breath.
  - Half ashamed half smiling at the things we did.
  - She made it clear from the start it was a one night stand.
  - But I was thinking of ways to make her change her plan.
  - Nobody else ever made me feel this way.
  - Sounds shallow well I'm sorry what should I say.
  - I like the way you move me.
  - I like the way you know how to do me.
  - Like the way you know what's on my mind.
  - I like the way you shake it.
  - I love the way you don't have to fake it.

  - Up in the mornin'
  - Out on the job
  - Work like the devil for my pay
  - But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
  - But roll around heaven all day.
  - Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
  - Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
  - While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
  - But roll around heaven all day
  - Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes
  - Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
  - Show me that river, take me across
  - Wash all my troubles away
  - Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
  - But roll around heaven all day
  - Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise

  - Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
  - Jack Frost nipping at your nose
  - Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
  - And folks dressed up like Eskimos
  - Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
  - Help to make the season bright
  - Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
  - Will find it hard to sleep tonight
  - They know that Santa's on his way
  - He's loaded lots of toys and goodies in his sleigh
  - And every mother's child is gonna spy
  - To see if reindeer really know how to fly
  - And so I'm offering this simple song
  - To kids from one to ninety-two
  - Although it's been said many times, many ways
  - Merry Christmas to you
  - And so I'm offering this simple song
  - To kids from one to ninety-two

  - The night's too dark for you to ever reach them, the lonely ones.

  - You try to leave the night behind you but wait...
  - You hear them still... You always will.

  - But in your mirror you see the one who is crying, the lonely ones.

  - Her father and her mother
  - Never showed her any affection at all
  - I wonder if it hurts her now
  - Now that it's too late they call
  - We let her down, it's true
  - We let her down, it's true
  - I told her I'd be there
  - It's easy to say what you want to believe
  - I told her I'd love her
  - Now that it's too late, I see
  - I let her down, it's true
  - I let her down
  - Let her down
  - Let her down
  - I let her down
  - So helpless, pretending
  - Hoping that somehow somebody would see
  - So desperate for someone
  - I guess that she thought that someone was me
  - I let her down, it's true
  - I let her down
  - I let her down
  - Look at her, look through her eyes
  - Closer the hurt and the pain
  - I hope now she's somewhere
  - Where they'll never hurt her again

  - An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
  - Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
  - When all at once a might heard of red-eyed cows he saw
  - Went plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
  - Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
  - Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
  - A bull of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
  - For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
  - Yippy-yi-ya, yippy-yi-yo
  - Ghost riders in the sky
  - Their faces gothed their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
  - Their ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught 'em yet
  - '''Cause they gotta ride forever on that range up in the sky'
  - On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry
  - Yippy-yi-ya, yippy-yi-yo
  - Ghost riders in the sky
  - The riders lopped on by him and he heard one call his name
  - If you wanna save your soul from hell for ridin' on our range
  - Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
  - Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
  - Yippy-yi-ya, yippy-yi-yo
  - Ghost riders in the sky
  - Ghost riders in the sky

  - I used to want to be a cowboy
  - Spent my childhood dreamin' that
  - Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
  - And a big ten-gallon hat
  - Chasin' outlaws, savin' ladies
  - Bustin' broncs at rodeos
  - Riding off into the sunset
  - Like they do in picture shows
  - I used to want to be a cowboy
  - I dreamed about it until the day
  - That a green-eyed Texas lady
  - Smiled and stole my heart away
  - Now I'm trackin' down a livin'
  - And as far as I can see
  - Right now I'm just as much a cowboy
  - As I'm ever gonna be
  - '''Cause my round-ups at a truck stop'
  - The trails a super slab
  - I wear boots up in the saddle
  - Of my eighteen wheelers cab
  - Riding hell bent for the bunkhouse
  - Just across the Georgia Line
  - Where tonight, I'll see my lady
  - And that little boy of mine
  - And he wants to be a cowboy
  - You know somehow I kind of expected that
  - Wearing spurs and boots and six guns
  - And a big ten-gallon hat
  - And all my cowboy dreams are livin'
  - In that little buckaroo
  - Cowboys often end up daddies
  - You know I'm really glad, they do
  - And he wants to be a cowboy
  - Just the way his daddy did
  - When he's on his broomstick pony
  - He's Hoppy, Roy and the Cisco Kid
  - And he wants to be a cowboy
  - Just the way his daddy did...

  - You finally graduated and she's ready for a wedding gown
  - But there's a great big world just waintin' out there for you
  - And if she really loves you she can wait another year or two
  - And nobody really knows how you feel inside
  - The road gets rough and the goin' gets tough, but you know you've got to try
  - And there ain't no way they're ever gonna change your mind
  - Don't everybody know that a cowboy's got to ride
  - Now your high school buddies say, "Man, you've gone insane
  - Don't you know rodeo is a crazy, foolish game"
  - But you can see in their eyes a little jealousy
  - They're all workin' 9-5, you're footloose and fancy free
  - And nobody really knows how you feel inside

  - And you leave his women be

  - And it never failed in every bar
  - Some redneck started a brawl
  - But the time and the booze and the broken bones
  - Finally put him out to graze

  - Ridin' and fighin' was all that I knew
  - Hard life and death was all that I'd seen

  - Nobody wants this pain and misery
  - But there still are some who think they can be
  - A cowboy like me
  - I spent one lonely winter in an old line shack
  - With beans in my belly rain on my back
  - A ration of coffee and a mountain of snow
  - With cattle to attend to at forty below
  - Then it's back for the round-up in April or May
  - You round-up the calf's boys and you cut out the strays
  - And you might touch a woman before the long summer ends
  - Then it's back to the line shack and do it all again
  - And all I have left are my stories to tell
  - Heaven's too far and I'm plumb scared of hell
  - Nobody wants this pain and misery
  - But there still are some who think they can be
  - A cowboy like me
  - I've given some bad guys a hard way to go
  - I busted my bones in them old time rodeos
  - I might have stretched truth, Lord, but I've never lied
  - Can't you tell I'm a cowboy by the scars on my side
  - Well, I rode with Cole Younger, I knew Jesse James
  - Me and old Wyatt use to ride on the range
  - And men all said sir to my Colt .45
  - And I was with Hitchcock the night he died

  - The settlers plowed under the tall prairie grass
  - And the cow town's died off in a world changing fast
  - But the wind kept the spirit alive

  - As he picked up his hat, well, the crowd cheered
  - '''Cause they knew a cowboy was born'

  - It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
  - I'd kept my nineteen dollars stuffed way down in my shoe
  - It cost me seven fifty for a dirty sleepin' room
  - My window faced the alley and the city smells were strong
  - I couldn't sleep for horns and sirens blowin' all night long
  - It ain't no place for a country boy, it ain't no place to be
  - It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
  - I didn't even bother to unpack the clothes that I brought
  - Some man paid me ten dollars for grandpas pocket watch
  - I got off the Trailways bus the same place I got on
  - My head is full of memories walkin' down the road to home
  - It ain't no place for a country boy, it ain't no place to be
  - It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me
  - It ain't no place for a country boy, it ain't no place to be
  - It might be fine for a city boy but it ain't no place for me

  - Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
  - Been through the best of his friends
  - On a long lonesome highway in an old pick-up truck
  - Cross Texas like a hot dusty wind
  - He was All Around Cowboy back in forty-nine
  - From the top it's been a long way down
  - Since the whiskey and the women started winning his time
  - They rode him high and hard to the ground
  - He remembers the thrill of being a winner
  - And the days of his first rodeo
  - There's something 'bout winnin' that don't last forever
  - Maybe tomorrow things will get better
  - If the devil lets loose of his soul
  - He'll be the All Around Cowboy again
  - So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
  - Wipes the whiskers that cover his chin
  - And he grins as he dreams of old rodeos
  - He's the All Around Cowboy again
  - He remembers the thrill of being a winner
  - And the days of his first rodeo
  - There's something 'bout winnin' that don't last forever
  - Maybe tomorrow things will get better
  - If the devil lets loose of his soul
  - He'll be the All Around Cowboy again

  - Folks used to think that I could ride any bronc or bull alive
  - And maybe in my younger days I could
  - But now I'm slowin' down a bit, friends tell me that I should quit
  - And if I didn't love it so I would
  - I recall when folks thought I was great and all the riders used to hate
  - To see my name upon the entry door
  - '''Cause I could ride and I could rope the others seemed to have no hope'
  - Lookin' at the buckle that I wore
  - It said, "All Around Cowboy of 1964"
  - Long days and lucky breaks helped me along
  - Working hard and riding fast and sleeping in the cold
  - Made me "All Around Cowboy of 1964"
  - Folks don't seem to realize the thrill I get from every ride
  - That bronc feels like pure dynamite to me
  - Scratched and bruised my body aches from the day to day abuse it takes
  - Lord only knows the way it sets me free
  - Now my days have shortened up I'm outa breaks and outa luck
  - And things will never be the same old way
  - As I look and shed a tear sometimes I can almost hear
  - The echos of the judges they would say
  - You're the "All Around Cowboy of 1964"
  - Long days and lucky breaks helped me along
  - Working hard and riding fast and sleeping in the cold
  - Made me "All Around Cowboy of 1964"
  - Yes, I'm the "All Around Cowboy of 1964"

  - I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
  - And lovin' the cowboy ways
  - Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
  - I burned up my childhood days
  - I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
  - Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
  - Just take what you need from the ladies then leave them
  - With the words of a sad country song
  - My heroes have always been cowboys
  - And they still are it seems
  - Sadly, in search of one step in back of
  - Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
  - Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
  - From being alone too long
  - You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
  - Knowin' well your best days are gone
  - Pickin' up ladies instead of my pen
  - I let the words of my youth fade away
  - Old worn-out saddles, an 'old worn-out memories
  - With no one and no place to stay
  - My heroes have always been cowboys
  - And they still are it seems
  - Sadly, in search of one step in back of
  - Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

  - Ain't nothing ever really bothered me
  - Some people rattle at the smallest things
  - I thought that I could handle anything
  - But I'm all wound up nothin' I can do
  - I get all wound up just from talkin' to you
  - I used to believe I was immune to love
  - But look at me now I'm all wound up
  - I never wondered what it's all about
  - Never saw a thing I couldn't do without
  - My feet are used to bein' on the ground
  - These days I wanna just kick 'em around
  - '''Cause I''m all wound up nothin'' I can do'
  - I get all wound up just from talkin' to you
  - I used to believe I was immune to love
  - But look at me now I'm all wound up
  - All wound up
  - All wound up
  - Fame and fortune I can take or leave
  - Ain't much about it that I really need
  - We're still together after all this time

  - They took my saddle in Houston
  - Broke my leg in Santa Fe

  - When they pull that gate
  - And I hope the judge ain't blind

  - Amarillo on my mind
  - Amarillo by morning

  - Everything that I've got
  - Is just what I've got on
  - I ain't got a dime
  - But what I've got is mine

  - Well, I grew up in the shadow of the Rockies
  - In the grand old West, yes sir I did
  - And dammed if we didn't have us a bunch of fun
  - Back when we was kids
  - Yea, there was manure on our britches
  - And snuff pouchin' out our lip
  - And hat's so big you can almost tell who's under it
  - Yea, we all had horses it was always a race
  - It was real important who got there first
  - We sneak along some of the old man's whisky
  - Just to quench our little thirst
  - Yea, we looked like a bunch of hon yaks
  - But we could ride like Casy Tibs
  - And we still had to learn how far we could go
  - Before we learned when to quit
  - Yea, we scratched where it itches and clowned around
  - There wasn't nobody who could kick our hound
  - Just throwin' knives and shootin' guns
  - Generally havin' a bunch of fun
  - Well, the mommas all thought we were angels
  - And hell we let 'em go right ahead
  - But the old man had a hew more savvy in him
  - And a feller had to be careful around him
  - Yea, wars were fought on contact
  - And wild seeds were sown
  - And we always spent our money like
  - We found it in the road
  - Well, one thing lead to another
  - And before we knowned it, it was gone
  - But I'd give you a hundred dollars
  - Just to have some more of them goings on
  - '''Cause we looked like a bunch of hon yaks'
  - But we could ride like Casy Tibs
  - And we still had to learn how far we could go
  - Before we learned when to quit
  - Yea, it's a lot of fun learning how far you can go
  - It's kinda hard learning when to quit
  - But I'll bet you already know

  - I was snappin out broncs at the Old Flyin' U
  - At forty a month a plum good buckaroo
  - Well, the boss comes around and he says
  - '"Hey, my lad, well you look pretty good ridin'' horses that''s bad"'
  - You see, I ain't got no more outlaws to break
  - But I'll buy you a ticket and I'll give you a stake
  - At ridin' them bad ones, well, you ain't slow
  - And you might do some good at the big rodeo
  - While they're puttin' the bull in the chute
  - I'm a strappin' my spurs to the heels of my boots
  - I looks that bull over and to my surprise
  - Well, he's a foot and a half in between his two eyes
  - On top of his shoulders he's got a big hump
  - I cinch's my riggin' just back of that lump
  - I latch in his middle and I lets out a scream
  - He comes out with a beller and the rest is a dream
  - Well, he jumps to the left and he lands towards the right
  - But I ain't no green horn, I'm still sittin' tight
  - The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin
  - He's a wavin' them horns right under my chin
  - At sunnin' his belly he couldn't be beat
  - He's showin' the buzzards the soles of his feet
  - He's a dippin' so low that my boots filled with dirt
  - He's a makin' a whip of the tail of my shirt
  - He's snappin' the buttons right off of my clothes
  - He's a-buckin' and a-bawlin' and a-blowin' his nose
  - The crowd starts to cheerin' both me and that bull
  - Well, he needed no help, but I had my hands full
  - Then he goes to fence rowin' and a-weavin' behind
  - My head went poppin', I sorta went blind
  - He starts in high divin', I lets out a groan
  - We went up together, but he come back alone
  - Up high I turns over and below I can see
  - He's a pawin' up dirt just a-waitin' for me
  - I can picture a grave and a big slab of wood
  - Sayin', "Here lies a twister who thought he was good"
  - I notice this somethin' don't seem can be true
  - But the brand on his hip was a big Flyin' U
  - When I landed he charged, but I got enough sense
  - To outrun that old bull to the hole in the fence
  - I dives through that hole and I want you to know
  - I ain't goin' back to no big rodeo
  - At a straddlin' them brahmas you can bet I'm all through
  - I'm sore footin' it back to the old Flyin' U

  - He was born and raised in Oklahoma
  - His blood lines were white and Cherokee
  - His daddy owned a ranch outside of Clairmore
  - Where he learned to ride before the age of three
  - Now young Will Rogers was a cowboy
  - And he practiced with his rope most everyday
  - He'd ride around the barn or 'cross the prairie
  - And threw a loop at anything that came his way
  - Yes, Will Rogers was a country boy
  - One of Oklahoma's favorite sons
  - The nation claimed him as their pride and joy
  - But his roots were deep in Oklahoma sod
  - Before too long he had his fill of schooling
  - At eighteen years he got the urge to roam
  - A whole great big world was out there waiting
  - So he saddled up and lit out on his own
  - He wrangled some ranches down in Texas
  - And he punched some cows out in New Mexico
  - Then he nearly starved to death in Argentina
  - Then in Africa he joined a Wild West show
  - Yes, Will Rogers was a country boy
  - One of Oklahoma's favorite sons
  - The nation claimed him as their pride and joy
  - But his roots were deep in Oklahoma sod
  - From the early days of Vaudeville to the big time
  - Folks that knew him said he'd never change
  - He was still the simple Oaklahoma cowboy
  - And no matter what he always stayed the same
  - Well, I suppose most of all he loved the people
  - Said he never met a man he didn't like
  - When times were hard and folks were feeling sorry
  - A word from Will would always bring a smile
  - Yes, Will Rogers was a country boy
  - One of Oklahoma's favorite sons
  - The nation claimed him as their pride and joy
  - But his roots were deep in Oklahoma sod
  - Yes, his roots were deep in Oklahoma sod

  - I went to see the preacher to teach me how to pray
  - He looked at me and smiled then that preacher turned away
  - Said, "If you want to tell him something, you ain't gotta fold your hands
  - Say it with your heart, your soul and believe it and I'll say, Amen"
  - Bang a drum for the sinners, bang a drum for your sins
  - Bang a drum for the losers and those who win
  - Bang a drum, bang it loudly or as soft as you need
  - Bang a drum for yourself son and a drum for me
  - Well, I called upon my brother just the other day
  - He said, "Jon, I'm gonna die if I don't start to live again
  - I work each day and night like clockwork, just tryin' to make ends meet
  - Well, I could kick this bad world's ass if I could just get on my feet"
  - Bang a drum for the dying, bang a drum for the truth
  - Bang a drum for the innocence lost in our youth
  - Bang a drum, bang it loudly or as soft as you need
  - Bang a drum for your brother and a drum for me
  - I don't know where all the rivers run
  - I don't know how far, I don't know how come
  - But I'm gonna die believin' with each step that I take
  - Ain't worth the ground that I walk if we don't walk it our own way
  - I don't claim to be a wise man, a poet or a Saint
  - Just another man who's searchin' for a better way
  - But my heart beats loud as thunder for the things that I believe
  - Sometimes I want to run for cover, sometimes I want to scream
  - Bang a drum for the tomorrow, bang a drum for the past
  - Bang a drum for the heroes who won't come back
  - Bang a drum for the promise, bang a drum for the lies
  - Bang a drum for the lovers and the tears they cry
  - Bang a drum, bang it loudly or as soft as you need
  - But as long as my heart keeps on banging I've got a reason to believe

  - And when my chance comes I'll give it a whirl
  - And try to win the championship of the world

  - When he said, "Son, you'd better stop foolin' around
  - You're gonna get your guts stomped into the ground"
  - You'll come flyin' from the chute with your tail up high
  - That old buckin' horse is gonna throw ya in the sky
  - When you come down you're gonna break your back
  - Then we'll all know you as Old Crippled-Up Jack

  - A young man in the saddle with his coat tails in the breeze
  - Got a six-gun on his right hip and a rifle at his knee
  - And he's dealin' in a game that he can't win
  - Poor Billy Bonney, you're only twenty-one

  - Now that wheel or fortune starts to turn
  - Your reputation's grown till it's the biggest in the land
  - And there ain't a lot of people left who wanna call your hand
  - And I guess you'll go down shootin' and like all brand of men
  - And when you shake hands with the Devil you get burned

  - A boy, a buckskin, and an ole spangler dawg
  - In the hills where the blue bonnets grew
  - Well, I was deep in the heart of Texas
  - Just a kid 'bout thirteen at the time
  - Runnin' wild through the mesquite, the cedars and cactus
  - It's been years, but you're still on my mind
  - No matter where I may wander
  - There's a memeory that I'll never lose
  - The Lonestar shines bright in my heart tonight
  - I've got the blue bonnet blues
  - Well, I remember those warm summer evenings
  - Layin' out under the stars
  - Back then I never dreamed we'd be leavin'
  - But I guess things just don't stay as they are
  - Well, the years and the miles came between us

  - He's one of the good guys it's plain to see
  - Sure enough cowboy though he's only three
  - There's a cute little filly she lives right next door

  - She'll offer him candy but he knows her game
  - He'll take what she gives him then be on his way
  - Blue eyes and freckles and holes in his jeans
  - Out in the backyard ridin' his dreams
  - He's our little cowboy until the day
  - Our fences can't hold him and he'll ride away
  - Saturday mornings he's up before dawn
  - Grabs his cap pistol and pulls his hat on
  - Today the Lone Ranger and him make their ride
  - Them outlaws better find some place to hide
  - With tears in his eyes and a scratch on his chin
  - His ornery old Cayuse done throwed him again
  - But a kiss and a cookie will soon ease the pain
  - He'll mount up and be back ridin' the range
  - Blue eyes and freckles and holes in his jeans
  - Out in the backyard ridin' his dreams
  - He's our little cowboy until the day
  - Our fences can't hold him and he'll ride away
  - Mama just look how our little boy's grown
  - He'll soon be a man with a mind of his own
  - And I know the hardest thing we'll ever do
  - Is take down the fences and just turn him loose
  - Blue eyes and freckles and faded blue jeans
  - He's grown up and ready to follow his dreams
  - He was our little cowboy just yesterday
  - Now the fences can't hold him and he'll ride away

  - And I could hear the Gators a-roar at night out on the old bayou
  - I remember Spanish Moss a-hangin' from the cypress trees
  - And the smell of honeysuckle on the Mississippi breeze
  - Thank you Mississippi for lovin' me
  - Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
  - Thank you for the old Cane Pole, the fishin' hole
  - The grits and black eyed peas
  - Thank you Mississippi for lovin' me
  - Then my family moved down to Texas when I was 12 years old
  - I took my first chew of plug tobacco and got hooked on rodeo
  - And I rode my Buckskin pony where the old Red River flows
  - And my Texas pride still makes me cry when I remember the Alamo
  - Thank you Texas for lovin' me
  - Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
  - Thank you for the country road, the horny toads
  - The chili and pinto beans
  - Thank you Texas for lovin' me
  - Now I live up in Wyoming and I love my home out on the range
  - But every now and then my mind goes roamin'
  - Down those country roads through my boyhood days

  - Thank you America for lovin' me
  - Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
  - Thank you for the country roads, the folks I've known
  - From sea to shinning sea
  - Thank you America, oh thank you America
  - Thank you mom and dad for lovin' me

  - Faded old blue wranglers, dusty cowboy hat
  - Pair of scuffed-up boots upon your feet
  - Can of pork and beans, that you opened with your knife
  - It ain't much but it's all you've got to eat
  - You think of what your daddy said if your money should run low
  - '"Just call I''ll send your busfare to come home"'
  - But you're just to proud to take it and home won't be the same
  - Now you've had a taste of rodeo
  - You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
  - To satisfy the hunger in your soul
  - You wouldn't turn back now even if you could
  - You were born to follow rodeo
  - All your money's gone 'cept a twenty dollar bill
  - But that's your fees to enter old Cheyenne
  - And all that's in your favor is you and your try
  - And a deep knawing desperate need to win
  - As you step out on the highway with your thumb up in the air
  - In your mind a promise has been made
  - If this way of life don't kill you
  - Or you don't starve to death
  - You swear you'll be the champion someday
  - You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
  - To satisfy the hunger in your soul
  - You wouldn't turn back now even if you could
  - You were born to follow rodeo
  - Faded old blue wranglers, dusty cowboy hat
  - Pair of scuffed-up boots upon your feet
  - Can of pork and beans that you open with your knife
  - It ain't much but it's all you've got to eat...

  - I was sittin' in a barroom one rainy afternoon
  - Tellin' stories about rodeo and listening to a tune
  - The rodeo starts tomorrow in this one horse town
  - So Bill took our names and put our entries down
  - I went to the office the next day to see
  - What bareback horse I had and pay me fees
  - I looked on the list but my name wasn't found
  - I thought Bill might have forgot to put me down
  - I looked on the board and I happened to find
  - My name was on another list I was in the bull ridin'
  - My knees began to knock and my face began to sweat
  - And I heaved and gagged on the rodeo office steps
  - Well, I may be a fool but a coward I'm not
  - So I borrowed a bull rope with a bell in the knot
  - I walked in the arena with them other bull ridin' fools
  - And walked down to the chutes and found my bull
  - Then I put my rope in the middle of his back
  - And had some cowboy pull out the slack
  - And then I wrapped the tail around my hand and back and said
  - '"Boy''s open the gate just a little bitty crack"'
  - Well, the bull hit the gate with his head
  - And I could see over his hump that his eyes were red
  - He bailed out of there with a big snort and beller
  - And something inside of me told me I was yeller
  - Well, the dust and hairs and flies come off his hump
  - It whisp to my nose as he made another jump
  - And the stink of it all was more than I could stand
  - So I jerked my wrap and opened my hand
  - Well, he jumped in the air and made one more turn
  - As the rope slid through my hand it sure did burn
  - He flang me down in a great big heap
  - Then right in the middle of me he did leap
  - With his feet on my belly standin' in place
  - That dirty old bull blew snot in my face
  - So them damned old bulls you can run 'em in a chute
  - And put your ropes on them big galloots
  - But the closest you're gonna find me to their stinkin' hair
  - Is to help some other fool get flug in the air

  - All the bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but I'm busted
  - Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted
  - Got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
  - A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
  - The county's gonna haul my belongings away I'm busted
  - Well, I went to brother Bill to get me a loan, I was busted
  - But I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, I'm busted
  - Brother Bill said, "You know there's not a thing I can do
  - My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
  - And I was just thinkin' on callin' on you 'cause I'm busted"
  - Lord, I'm no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
  - The food that we canned last summer's gone and I'm busted
  - All the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow
  - Me and my family's got to pack up and go
  - Where I'll make a livin' the Lord only knows, I'm busted

  - Wild as a coastal barronca, swift as the wind blowing free
  - With two eyes like fire brands that glow in the night
  - Somewhere up there he's waiting for me
  - And he knows that I'm coming' for him
  - And I just can't rest till I find
  - That raven black stallion that wears no man's brand
  - With a wild restless spirit like mine
  - They call him Caballo Diablo
  - Half-horse, half-devil they say
  - Caballo Diablo, the outlaw
  - Up a top the Sierra Madre
  - Two men before tried to take him
  - They had their chance one by one
  - But each met his fate when those flashing' black hooves
  - Brought death 'neath the Mexican sun
  - Still I can't leave, I must find him
  - You fool of a horse, can't you see?
  - I may be half man, but the other half's devil
  - And you're just exactly like me
  - They call him Caballo Diablo
  - Half-horse, half-devil they say
  - Caballo Diablo, the outlaw
  - Up a top the Sierra Madre
  - Even the breezes stopped moving, oh hush now be still
  - Don't make a sound stay close to the ground
  - '''Cause he''s waitin'' just over that hill'
  - Downwind behind him move quickly
  - Do it fast now, he's starting to stir
  - Grab a handful of mane and up on to his back
  - And start raking him down with your spurs
  - But try as he will he can't shake me
  - As over the precipice we go
  - To shed the life blood of a horse and a man
  - On the rocky sierra below
  - They call him Caballo Diablo
  - Half-horse, half-devil they say
  - Caballo Diablo, the outlaw
  - Up a top the Sierra Madre

  - Hold tight with a leather fist, watch out when he starts to twist
  - What their daddies used to tell them boys how to ride them bulls
  - I got a jingle in my jeans, sore places in between
  - And I'm leavin' old Salt Lake with a push and a pull
  - 10-4 Buddy, come on back, a horse trailer on a Cadillac
  - Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy in the Coupe de Ville
  - Chug-a-luggin' up one side, slidin' down the other
  - I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
  - Turn up that radio don't wanna think about a rodeo
  - Don't wanna think about a round-up, up in old Cheyenne
  - It's a crazy circuit ah but still you work it
  - Turn down that sound, boys, let's get up and check the scan
  - 10-4 Buddy, come on back, a horse trailer on a Cadillac
  - Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy in the Coupe de Ville
  - Chug-a-luggin' up one side, slidin' down the other
  - I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
  - Bandana hangin' mirror still wet from ear to ear
  - Well, I guess it's true then what the wise men say
  - When you ride your last one make sure he's the best one
  - Jump while he's movin', tip your hat boys and walk away
  - 10-4 Buddy, come on back, a horse trailer on a Cadillac
  - Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy in the Coupe de Ville

  - Well, the well went dry and the cow did too
  - And daddy didn't know what to do
  - The banker came by the house one day
  - He said he's gonna take the farm away
  - Then mama came up with a plan
  - Brother and me started up a band
  - Sister put a sign on the roof
  - And daddy bought a case of 90 proof
  - Now we called it the Cadillac Ranch
  - They're parking cars in the old bean patch
  - There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
  - Till the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch
  - Now the only thing that we raise is cane
  - You don't need the sun or rain
  - Just some neon lights saying some ice cold beer
  - Keeps everything green around here
  - Mama takes the cash at the door
  - Brother and me keep them out on the floor
  - Sister sets them up at the bar
  - And daddy kicks back with a big cigar
  - Now we called it the Cadillac Ranch
  - They're parking cars in the old bean patch
  - There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
  - Till the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch
  - Well, we gave all the cows away
  - Now the only horns around here today
  - Are the ones up on the grill
  - Of a genuine '59 Coupe De Ville
  - Now we called it the Cadillac Ranch
  - They're parking cars in the old bean patch
  - There's a bar in the barn and the place stays packed
  - Till the cows come home at Cadillac Ranch
  - Now we called it the Cadillac Ranch
  - They're parking cars in the old bean patch

  - The Calico Moon was rising that night
  - Shining like gold on the water
  - Me and my brother we hijacked a rowboat
  - Set out like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer
  - Oars dippin' diamonds
  - As we rowed across the lake
  - An owl sang to who knows who
  - Lost in the wonder under the Calico Moon
  - The Calico Moon lay soft on your skin
  - It was a night that I'll always remember
  - Our hearts filled with fire, holding each other
  - Love flowed as wild as the river
  - We talked of how we were meant to be
  - And how sometimes dreams do come true
  - We were young lovers under the Calico Moon
  - Now that old moon has rolled around so many times since then
  - And here we are still gazing at the night
  - We're captured in the magic of its spell again
  - You and I
  - The Calico Moon wakes in the East
  - And hangs on an amber horizon
  - When I see its light dance in your eyes
  - It reminds me of how lucky I am
  - Where would I be if I didn't have you?
  - Lord only knows what I'd do
  - And thank God in heaven for you and the Calico Moon

  - Storm clouds are building above the timber line
  - Lightning flashing across the mountain side
  - Thunder's rolling down the canyons of his mind
  - Somewhere beyond the Great Divide
  - The bugle of the Bull Elk echoes through the pines
  - The North wind moans her lonesome lullaby
  - He hungers for the freedom of an eagle as she glides
  - Somewhere beyond the Great Divide
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - The mountain's callin' to him
  - Like a mother calls her child
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - Living in the city, oh it gets to be a grind
  - Putting in his hours working overtime
  - Waiting for the day he can leave it all behind
  - To go somewhere beyond the Great Divide
  - He's got to get away from this city for a while
  - He's got to answer the call of the wild
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - The mountain's callin' to him
  - Like a mother calls her child
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - He's heard the call of the wild
  - He's heard the call of the wild

  - The blood on my sheets has soaked through the bandage
  - That they wrapped around the stitches in my side
  - These old country doctors have come to expect it
  - From the cowboys that come here once a year to ride
  - Now starin' at the ceiling I'm trying to get my senses
  - But I can't recall too much of yesterday
  - Except for some cussin' at that bull we call Chisum
  - As they turned us out of chute number 3
  - Chisum, Chisum you're a big bad son of a gun
  - Your hide is tough and it's been scarred
  - Where spurs have dug in deep but never hung
  - Chisum, you're the only reason that I keep on riding
  - And I'll ride you before my ridin's done
  - Someone's brought in the paper and I'm starin' unbelievin'
  - At the story that's laid out before my eyes
  - It talks about you Chisum how they brought you up from Texas
  - And the cowboy that made a valiant 7 second ride
  - It mentions how you broke your leg when we went down together
  - And it talks about your horn in my side
  - But it's goin' on to say how they had to put you away
  - But it don't tell about the tears in my eyes
  - Chisum, Chisum I love you, you son of a gun
  - Your hide was tough and it was scarred
  - Where my spurs had dug in deep but never hung
  - Chisum, I tell you my ridin' days are done
  - '''Cause after you there''s nothing left to ride'
  - Chisum, Chisum you're a big bad son of a gun
  - Your hide is tough and it's been scarred
  - Where spurs have dug in deep but never hung
  - Chisum, I tell you my ridin' days are done
  - '''Cause after you there''s nothing left to ride'

  - The canyons are throwin' dust in the storms eye
  - And the storms gettin' angry I know that it's so
  - It's fixin' to blow a little more of Colorado
  - It seems to be a twister as the clouds begin to cry
  - And there goes momma clothesline leavin' on the fly
  - Here come the rain drops ten thousand four
  - It's gonna wash away our little part of Colorado
  - The mules are gettin' restless it's hard to keep 'em shy
  - Don't they know they've got to get us to the other side
  - The fence is fallin' down and the barns about to go
  - As I watch the storm take away my part of Colorado
  - Most of all we won our lives and that's a fact
  - And what little we're taking the wind wants it back
  - Run, momma run, and try to get the mules to go
  - And God help us get the hell away from Colorado
  - I look out to the east of the Colorado sky

  - The first time I saw him was over in Tucson
  - When he asked what the bronc ridin' paid
  - Well, me and the boys we all had us a laugh
  - When we saw that his hair was in braids
  - He drawed a good mount you should a seen how
  - He used that old horse 'til the gun
  - Well, I've never seen me no Indian cowboy
  - But that feller Joe Cy was one
  - He's a rodeo Indian cowboy you bet
  - And he's tough as Buffalo's hide
  - They say the worst kind of cayuse get scared
  - When he finds out he's drawed up Joe Cy
  - He's wild as a war dancin', ready to reach for
  - A hand full of sweet suicide
  - He's a rodeo Indian cowboy for sure
  - When they say come ridin' Joe Cy
  - Some feller told me he was raised up a Mustang
  - Somewhere on the Montana plains
  - Said he'd already rode him a nightmare to hell
  - Or his spur whipped the devil half lame
  - The harder they try him, the better he likes 'em
  - That Joe Cy is one more good man
  - He's a rodeo Indian double tough cowboy
  - And an all around rodeo hand
  - Well, he laughed when he told me
  - He'd traded his trophies
  - Gold buckles and saddles and stuff
  - For some good land and livestock
  - To start him a school for the Indian kids sure enough
  - Well, he's teachin' 'em, ridin' and ropin'
  - And Joe says that they're all a makin' top hands
  - So watch out your pale faces come National Finals
  - We'll have one more Custer's last stand
  - He's a rodeo Indian cowboy you bet
  - And he's tough as Buffalo's hide
  - They say the worst kind of cayuse gets scared
  - When he finds out he's drawed up Joe Cy
  - He's wild as a war dancin', ready to reach for
